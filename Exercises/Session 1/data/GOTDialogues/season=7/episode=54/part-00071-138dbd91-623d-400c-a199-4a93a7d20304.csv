JON(to Gendry),Are you all right? GENDRY faces JON and grunts
TORMUND,"Beautiful, eh? I can breath again"
JON,You've never been down south
TORMUND,I've been to Winterfell
JON,That's the north
JON,There's not another woman within 100 miles of here
TORMUND,We have to make due with what we've got
TORMUND,This one is maybe not so smart
JON,Davos says he is a strong fighter
TORMUND,Good
TORMUND,Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead
"So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And? JON",She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee
TORMUND,You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling
THOROS,Priestess
BERIC,We're fighting a great war
GENDRY,I wanted to be one of you
"Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked -- SANDOR",Sounds all right so far
GENDRY,-- and put leeches on me
GENDRY,Yes
SANDOR,It could have been worse
GENDRY,She wanted to kill me
SANDOR,Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something
SANDOR,This one's been killed six times
THOROS,Good lad
JON,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father
JORAH,He was a good man
Were you with him at the end? JON,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings
JORAH,I can't think of a worse way for him to go
JON,I hate that he died that way
JORAH,Your father wanted to execute me
JON,I heard
JORAH,He was in the right of course
JON,I'm glad he didn't capture you
JORAH,Me too
JON,Your father gave me this sword
JON,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros
JON,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries
JORAH,He gave it to you
JON,I'm not his son
JORAH,I brought shame to my house
JORAH,I forfeited the right to claim this sword
CUT TO,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD Snow is falling into the courtyard
ARYA,Father used to watch us from up here
SANSA,I remember
ARYA,One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick
ARYA,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me
SANSA,What? ARYA retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it
ARYA,That's your pretty handwriting
Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt -- SANSA,You don't have to read it
ARYA,"\"Father has been charged with treason"
"\" SANSA",They forced me to do it
ARYA,Did they
With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop? SANSA,You don't know what it was like
ARYA,So was I
SANSA,They told me it was the only way to save father
ARYA,And you were stupid enough to believe them
SANSA,But you didn't
ARYA,I didn't betray him
SANSA,You should be on your knees thanking me
"The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world? ARYA",I was training
SANSA,Training
ARYA,"Oh, I don't know about that"
SANSA,You never would have survived what I survived
ARYA,I guess we'll never know
SANSA,What are you doing to do with that letter
ARYA,I don't know yet
SANSA,Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants
"This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart -- ARYA",The northern lords will read it
"Are you going to say, \"But I was just a child\"? SANSA",You're angry
ARYA,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things
CUT TO,- BEYOND THE WALL The raiding party are marching single file acorss the frozen tundra
TORMUND,You're one big ugly dog
SANDOR,Fuck off
TORMUND,They told me you were mean
Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings? SANDOR,I don't give two shits about Wildlings
SANDOR,Gingers I hate
TORMUND,Gingers are beautiful
SANDOR,Don't point your fucking finger at me
TORMUND,Ever since you've been mean
TORMUND,Ah
SANDOR,I bet you do
TORMUND,Nope
SANDOR,Brienne of Tarth
SANDOR,How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver? TORMUND nods
TORMUND,You do know her
SANDOR,We've met
TORMUND,I want to make babies with her
BERIC,You don't much look like him
JON,I serve the north
BERIC,The north didn't raise you from the dead
JON,The lord of light never spoke to me
BERIC,He wants you alive
JON,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know"
BERIC,I think about that all the time
JON,But we all die
BERIC,The enemy always wins
JON,"\"I am the shield that guards the realms of men"
"\" BERIC",Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that
JON,Aye
SANDOR,That's what I saw in the fire
SANDOR,A mountain like an arrowhead
THOROS,Are you sure? SANDOR turns to THOROS and nods his head
SANDOR,We're getting close
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE TYRION is sitting in a chair staring into the fire
DAENERYS,Do you know what I like about you? TYRION turns to look at DAENERYS
TYRION,I honestly don't
DAENERYS,You're not a hero
TYRION,Oh
TYRION,I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing
DAENERYS,I don't want you to be a hero
TYRION,It's interesting these heroes you name
DAENERYS,Jon Snow's not in love with me
TYRION,"Oh, my mistake"
