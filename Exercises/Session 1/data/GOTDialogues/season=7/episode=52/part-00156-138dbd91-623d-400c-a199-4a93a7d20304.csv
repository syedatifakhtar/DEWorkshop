RANDYLL,My Lord
DICKON,My Lord

The gold -- CERSEI,Is on its way
TYCHO,Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed
CERSEI,We must devise a way to raise their spirits
TYCHO,Yes
CERSEI,My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it
TYCHO,I see a great deal of potential in that venture
I imagine that it would require outside investment? CERSEI,It will indeed
TYCHO,I know them well
CERSEI,That's good to hear
TYCHO,"Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives"
