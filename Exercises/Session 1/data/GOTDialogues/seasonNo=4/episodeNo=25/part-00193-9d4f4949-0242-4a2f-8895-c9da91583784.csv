JON,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation
SAM,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret"
So what's it like? JON,It's
"well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet! SAM","No, you're really not"
JON,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart
SAM,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine
JON,There will
SAM,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do
JON,"Go get some sleep, Sam"
TORMUND,Oh that was a night to remember
Many's the man who-- YGRITTE,I know you never fucked a bear
TORMUND,We could be waiting here a while
YGRITTE,Good
STYR,You've got a lot to say about killing
YGRITTE,Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did
STYR,Yes
YGRITTE,I probably killed him already
STYR,So you've said
YGRITTE,And if not
STYR,And more words
YGRITTE,Jon Snow is mine
AEMON,"Oh, no need"
SAM,But what he says about what they do
AEMON,Yes
SAM,I don't love her
AEMON,Yes you do
SAM,No
AEMON,Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me
AEMON,You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do
Sam leaves the room and outside hears Gilly at the gate talking with Pypar PYP,"I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody"
It's orders! GILLY,They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby
"I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please! PYP","I'm sorry, I can't"
GILLY,"If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do"
SAM,Pyp! Open the gate
PYP,I can't
SAM,"Oh, Pyp"
Open the fucking gate! [Pyp goes to open the gate PYP,I've never heard you curse before
SAM,"Yes, well, best get used to it"
[Gilly runs inside and Sam embraces her SAM,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright"
GILLY,It was horrible
SAM,I'm so so sorry
GILLY,"Don't let them send me away, Sam"
SAM,Never
GILLY,I know there's no women allowed
SAM,Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me
[A horn sounds in the distance ALLISER,Get ready! [Members of the Night's Watch can be heard shouting frantically
Cut to Thenn warg whose eyes turn back to normal THENN WARG,It's time
ALLISER,You can say it if you like
JON,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser"
ALLISER,"Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every little twat with a mouth"
Gilly lays her baby on a sack of something SAM,You'll be safe down here
SAM,I
GILLY,How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you
SAM,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there
GILLY,"Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here"
SAM,Look
[Sam kisses Gilly GILLY,Promise me you won't die
SAM,I promise you I won't die
"Pyp sets some arrows up then stands back, scared SAM",There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side
PYP,I've never thrown a spear before
You're not afraid? SAM,"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us"
She sees Sam in the tower and she runs down the hill toward the other Wildlings YGRITTE,Most of their men are up top
The Night's Watch perched upon the wall look down at them in awe ALLISER,"Archers knock, everyone else hold"
Draw! MEMBER 1,"Help, down below"
"On the other side, Ygritte continues to let loose flaming arrows TORMUND","You, over there"
SAM,If you keep missing we will
Alliser steps off the lift and walks towards the Night's Watch ALLISER,Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle
[Night's Watch cheers ALLISER,The Night's Watch will stand
[Night's Watch cheers ALLISER,"With me now! Now, with me! [Alliser and the Night's Watch rush at the Wildlings that have scaled the gate"
On the other side Rayder's troops advance JANOS,No discipline
JON,Those are giants riding mammoths down there
"Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them? JANOS",No such thing as giants
GRENN,Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below
JANOS,Needed below? Yes
ED,I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were
[Archers of the Night's Watch are lowered perpendicular to The Wall JON,Knock! Draw! Loose! [A Wildling tries to shoot an arrow up at The Wall unsuccessfully
PYP,I got one
He falls into Sam's arms SAM,You're alright
Two giants and a mammoth approach the gate and begin pulling at it with long ropes JON,*to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold
GRENN,Alright
JON,*grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate
GRENN,They won't
Alliser falls to the ground and gets dragged underneath ALLISER,"Hold the fucking gate! Hold it! [Sam sits with Pyp on his lap, dead"
Grenn and the men that came down with him get off the lift SAM,*to Grenn* We need more men down here
GRENN,We have to hold the gate
SAM,But we need men here
GRENN,Tell Jon! He's in command
Do you hear me? [Olly raises the lift SAM,"And find a weapon, Olly"
JON,Ed
[Jon leaves his post and grabs his sword JON,Two brothers now fight with me
ED,"Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up"
GRENN,"You heard Jon, we hold the gate"
DONNEL,Jon Snow's not Lord Commander
GRENN,The gods aren't down here
"It's the six of us, you hear me? DONNEL","No, please"
"[The giant rushes toward the inner gate as Grenn and his men stand in fear, ready to fight GRENN","Night gathers, and now my watch begins"
I shall wear no crowns All TOGETHER,And win no glory
"I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come! [Jon, Sam, and the other men ride the lift to the bottom JON",*to Sam* I don't want you out there
SAM,You can't protect me forever
[Jon hands Sam a key JON,I need him more than I need you
Sam runs to a door and unlocks it SAM,We need you boy
Jon rushes to catch Ygritte YGRITTE,Jon Snow
JON,"No, shh, don't talk"
JON,We'll go back there
YGRITTE,"You know nothing, Jon Snow"
[The Night's Watch cheers in excitement ED,Don't cheer too loud
"[Inside Castle Black's walls Tormund is still alive, swinging his sword with two arrows in his back JON",Tormund
TORMuND,This is how a man ends
[Jon grabs a crossbow and shoots Tormund in the leg then kicks away his weapon JON,Put him in chains
She grabs a leg of meat as a weapon and rushes the door SAM,Woah! It's me
Sam and Jon descend the stairs SAM,We held them off
JON,For one night
SAM,This is a great victory
JON,Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses
SAM,To
JON,Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance
SAM,They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him
JON,He'll kill me
SAM,He won't just kill ya
They'll make it last days! JON,You're right
The giant and Grenn and his men are dead on the ground JON,They held the gate
SAM,Jon
