STANNIS’ CAMP - MORNING DAVOS,"A band of 20 men, maybe less"
STANNIS,"Put last night’s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy"
DAVOS,"Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black"
STANNIS,We’re not returning to Castle Black
DAVOS,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters"
STANNIS,Have the dead horses butchered for meat
"Jon steps forward, Alliser stares for a moment, then-- ALLISER",Open the gates
JON,It was a failure
SAM,It wasn’t
JON,"I went to save them, I failed"
SAM,"You didn’t fail him, or him, or her"
JON,I don’t think that fact’s lost on them
ALLISER,"You have a good heart, Jon Snow"
DAVOS,"You sent for me, Your Grace"
STANNIS,"Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I’m sending you back to Castle Black"
DAVOS,"Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand"
STANNIS,Yes
DAVOS,"The King’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war"
STANNIS,"You’re not abandoning me, you’re obeying a command"
DAVOS,A boy with a scroll could deliver this message
STANNIS,"And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn’t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don’t come back empty handed"
DAVOS,"Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me"
STANNIS,My family stays with me
DAVOS,At least let me take Shireen
STANNIS,My family stays with me
DAVOS,Well that sounds like a proper story
SHIREEN,Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar
DAVOS,"But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield"
SHIREEN,And burnt him to a crisp
DAVOS,Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann
SHIREEN,Thank you
DAVOS,You’re very welcome
SHIREEN,You’ll just have to read it yourself
JAIME,Prince Doran
(bows) DORAN,"Forgive us, we started without you"
JAIME,Princess Myrcella
MYRCELLA,Uncle
JAIME,What a lovely dress
MYRCELLA,Not at all
JAIME,Prince Trystane
How’s your jaw? TRYSTANE,A fleabite
DORAN,And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force
JAIME,We received a threatening message
MYRCELLA (surprised),That necklace was stolen from my room
JAIME,Ah
DORAN,We can’t behead you
ELLARIA,"No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters"
DORAN,And that is precisely what we are doing
DORAN,I cannot disobey my King’s command
JAIME,I accept
DORAN,One more thing
JAIME,You have my word
ELLARIA,The word of a Kingslayer
ELLARIA,No wonder you can’t stand
DORAN,"You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much"
DORAN,Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day
TRYSTANE,I have learned the value of mercy from my father
JAIME,You’re a good man
TRYSTANE,On one condition
NYMERIA,"Why do we play? I’m better than you, I’ll always be better than you"
TYENE,You’re going to miss
NYMERIA,I never miss
TYENE,You will
NYMERIA,Luck
TYENE,Now it’s my turn
NYMERIA,You’re too slow
TYENE,"Say it one more time, handsome"
Who am I? BRONN,The most beautiful woman in the world
JAIME,"Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater"
BRONN,Only the one
JAIME,I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane
BRONN,Prince
JAIME,Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy
BRONN,I’m glad to hear it
JAIME,There was one condition
DORAN,Perhaps some soup instead? EXT
ARYA,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock-- Two shady looking men approach her"
MAN,How much for your little clam? They laugh and walk away
ARYA,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Arya stops her cart, inspects the vile Jaqen gave to her, and tucks it back in her pouch"
THIN MAN (waving),Come on
THIN MAN,"Some oysters, girl! I’m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?! Arya looks to the dock, and sees Meryn Trant and Mace Tyrell being helped off the boat"
BANKER,"Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos"
MACE,Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful
BANKER,I’m afraid I don’t partake
BRAAVOS - IRON BANK MACE,"Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable"
BANKER,I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter
MACE,Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands
BANKER,Most unfortunate for the glovers
MACE,"If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble"
BANKER,"We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell"
MACE,You are the world's best gamblers
BANKER,I’m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do
MACE,"Oh, nonsense"
Do you sing? BANKER,I don't have that gift
MACE,"It's not a gift, it’s a skill, anyone can learn it"
MERYN,I thought that old shit would never stop singing
MAN,"It wasn’t bad, though"
MERYN,"The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts"
MERYN,"This is the place, lads"
BROTHEL KEEPER,Sell your fish somewhere else
PROSTITUTE,"Oh let her in, Brusco, I’m hungry"
PROSTITUTE,They say oyster’s get the juices flowing
ARYA,Three coppers
JOHN,Here’s a silver because the lady likes you
MERYN,Too old
HEAD PROSTITUTE,Brea
MERYN,Too old
HEAD,I have just the one
MERYN,Too old
MAN,"Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry"
MAN,Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters
MAN 2,I’ll have one
HEAD,Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo! The head prostitute brings in a child
MERYN,Good
MERYN,I’ll tell you when we’re done
MERYN,You’ll have a fresh one for me tomorrow
HEAD,Of course
HEAD,"I’ll have you whipped, girl! Go on! Arya leaves the room, but takes one last glance at where Meryn is taking the girl"
MAN,Valaar morghulis
JAQEN,Perhaps that’s why the man is thin
ARYA,Tomorrow
JAQEN,Tomorrow
JAQEN,A girl has work to do
DORAN,Your rebellion is over
DORAN,I believe in second chances
ELLARIA,You write like a 7 year old
JAIME,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me
The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home JAIME,She will
ELLARIA,I wasn’t talking about her
ELLARIA,You think I disapprove
ELLARIA,I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved
SHIREEN,Father
Aren’t you cold? STANNIS,No
What are you reading? SHIREEN,The Dance of Dragons
STANNIS,Doesn’t make much sense
SHIREEN,I think it’s poetic
STANNIS,Sometimes a person has to choose
SHIREEN,"It’s alright, father"
STANNIS,You don’t even know what I’m talking about
SHIREEN,It doesn’t matter
Is there any way I can help? STANNIS,Yes there is
SHIREEN,"Good, I want to"
STANNIS,Forgive me
SHIREEN,Where’s my father? I want to see my father
MELISANDRE,"It will all be over soon, Princess"
SHIREEN,"Where’s my father? No you can’t do this, father where are you?! Stannis watches on from the crowd"
MELISANDRE,"The year is now, my Lord"
STANNIS,There’s no other way
SELYSE,No
ANNOUNCER (Valyrian),"Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games! The Announcer raises his hands and the crowd begins to roar"
ANNOUNCER,"My queen, our first contest"
STRONG,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen"
HIZDAHR,They’re waiting for you
DAARIO,"That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money"
TYRION,The smaller man it is
DAENERYS,I’m not putting my money anywhere
HIZDAHR,Kings and queens never bet on the games
DAARIO,People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits
HIZDAHR,"I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not"
DAENERYS,"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you? Hizdahr is silent"
DAARIO,"Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me"
HIZDAHR,I’m not talking about myself
TYRION,My father would have liked you
ANNOUNCER,A Meereenese champion? The crowd applauds
HIZDAHR (looks at pit),Those men think they’re dying for a good reason
DAENERYS,Someone else’s reason
HIZDAHR,"So your reasons are true, and theirs are false"
TYRION,"Well said, you’re an eloquent man"
ANNOUNCER,
),"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen"
TYRION,You can end this
HIZDAHR,She cannot
TYRION,You can! The fighter holds his blade to Jorah’s throat
DAARIO,Protect your queen! The Sons of the Harpy start slitting the throats of former slaves and Unsullied in the crowd
HIZDAHR,"Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way-- Two Sons of the Harpy come up on Hizdahr from behind and stab him to death"
TYRION,Stay close! Sons of the Harpy have began to rush the pit
JORAH,"This way! They run through the exit, but a door swings shut"
DAARIO,"The other side, follow me! They rush towards the other side and join up with Tyrion and Missandei"
DAARIO,"Protect your queen! Jorah, Daario, and the Unsullied form a ring around Missandei, Daenerys, and Tyrion in the center of the pit"
DAENERYS,Drogon! She takes a spear from his neck
DAENERYS,Valahd
