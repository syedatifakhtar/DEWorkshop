Tyrion Lannister,"Oh, I’m very sorry"
Lysa Arryn,You’ve had your little joke
Tyrion Lannister,"Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King’s Justice? I’m accused and demand a trial"

Eddard Stark,Grand Maester Pycelle
Grand Maester Pycelle,My Lord
Eddard Stark,Send a raven to Casterly Rock
Petyr Baelish,"A bold move, my Lord, and admirable"
