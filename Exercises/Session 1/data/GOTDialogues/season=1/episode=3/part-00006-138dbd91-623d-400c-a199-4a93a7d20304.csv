King’s Landing Guard,"Welcome, Lord Stark"
Eddard Stark,Get the girls settled in
Jory Cassel,"Yes, my Lord"
King’s Landing Guard,"If you'd like to change into something more appropriate… Ned Stark gives the guard a blank stare before taking off his gloves, the guard realizes Ned’s disinterest and the two begin walking to the council chamber"
Jaime Lannister,"Thank the gods you're here, Stark"
Eddard Stark,Glad to see you're protecting the throne
Jaime Lannister,Sturdy old thing
Eddard Stark,Very handsome armor
Jaime Lannister,I know
Eddard Stark,You've chosen your opponents wisely then
Jaime Lannister,I have a knack for it
Eddard Stark,But you just stood there and watched
Jaime Lannister,500 men just stood there and watched
"If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more? Eddard Stark","You served him well, when serving was safe"
Varys,Lord Stark
Eddard Stark,Lord Varys
Varys,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad
Eddard Stark,A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son
Renly Baratheon,And you look tired from the road
Petyr Baelish,But we have a Kingdom to look after
Eddard Stark,"She has, Lord Baelish"
Petyr Baelish,All too well
Eddard Stark,Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with
Petyr Baelish,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord"
Grand Maester Pycelle,"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark"
Eddard Stark,Grand Maester
Grand Maester Pycelle,How many years has it been? You were a young man
Eddard Stark,And you served another King
Grand Maester Pycelle,How forgetful of me
Varys,His Grace has many cares
Petyr Baelish,We are the lords of small matters here
Renly Baratheon,My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King
Eddard Stark,I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm
Grand Maester Pycelle,"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen"
Renly Baratheon,"\"Counting coppers,\" he calls it"
Eddard Stark,I'll speak to him tomorrow
Petyr Baelish,As you will
Eddard Stark,There will be no plans until I speak to Robert
Varys,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure"
Cersei Baratheon,"Please, it's nearly healed"
Joffrey Baratheon,It's ugly
Cersei Baratheon,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf"
Joffrey Baratheon,I'm not like him
Cersei Baratheon,That's not true
Joffrey Baratheon,I don't want to
Cersei Baratheon,"No, but you will"
Joffrey Baratheon,We allow the northerners too much power
Cersei Baratheon,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers"
Joffrey Baratheon,I'm not asking
Cersei Baratheon,The North cannot be held
Joffrey Baratheon,So you agree
The Starks are enemies? Cersei Baratheon,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy
Septa Mordane,"Enough of that, young lady"
Arya Stark,I'm practicing
Sansa Stark,The Hound killed your friend
Arya Stark,The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do
Sansa Stark,You're an idiot
Arya Stark,You're a liar
Septa Mordane,Enough! Septa Mordane begins escorting Arya away from the table as Ned walks in
Eddard Stark,Go to your room
Eddard Stark,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys
Don't you like it? Sansa Stark,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight
May I be excused? Septa Mordane,You've barely eaten a thing
Eddard Stark,It's all right
Eddard Stark,War was easier than daughters
May I come in? Whose sword is that? Arya Stark,Mine
Eddard Stark,Give it to me
Arya Stark,I wasn't playing
Eddard Stark,Come here
Now what do you want with this? Arya Stark,It's called Needle
Eddard Stark,A blade with a name
And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting? Arya Stark,Stick 'em with the pointy end
Eddard Stark,[laughs That's the essence of it
Arya Stark,I was trying to learn
Eddard Stark,"No, sweet girl"
Arya Stark,I hate them! I hate all of them
Eddard Stark,Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen
Arya Stark,So was I! He is a liar
Eddard Stark,"Darling, listen to me"
Arya Stark,Winter is coming
Eddard Stark,You were born in the long summer
Arya Stark,I don't hate her
Eddard Stark,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either"
Old Nan,Don't listen to it
Bran Stark,I hate your stories
Old Nan,I know a story about a boy who hated stories
Bran Stark,Those weren't my favorites
Old Nan,"Oh, my sweet summer child"
Robb Stark,Get your supper
Bran Stark,Maybe we do
Robb Stark,How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times
Bran Stark,I did though
Robb Stark,Don't ever say that
Bran Stark,I'd rather be dead
Rodrick Cassel,"Fewer eyes back here, my Lady"
Catelyn Stark,It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital
Rodrick Cassel,My Lady
Guard,"Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark"
Would you mind following us? Catelyn Stark,I would
Guard,We've been instructed to escort you into the city
Catelyn Stark,"Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but"
Guard,"Follow me, Lady Stark"
Petyr Baelish,Cat! Go on
(to his whores) Catelyn Stark,"You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a… Two naked whores interrupt, Baelish snaps at them to leave"
Petyr Baelish,I meant no disrespect to you of all people
Varys,Lady Stark
Catelyn Stark,Lord Varys
Varys,To see you again after so many years is a blessing
Petyr Baelish,"Well well, this is an historic day"
Alliser Thorne,"If that were a real sword, you'd be dead"
Alliser Thorne,"Next! Jon quickly dispatches of another newcomer, we see Lord Commander Jeor and Tyrion looking on from a balcony"
Alliser Thorne,"Next! Another man starts againt Jon Snow, as another joins, Jon defeats the two of them almost instantly"
Alliser Thorne,"Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here"
Tyrion Lannister,A charming man
Jeor Mormont,I don't need him to be charming
Grand Maester Pycelle,Lord Stark
Petyr Baelish,Is she? Baelish leads Ned to the entrance of his brothel
Petyr Baelish,I thought that she'd be safest in here
Eddard Stark,You're a funny man
Grenn,"If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit"
Pyp,I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did
Grenn,"We'll talk later, Lord Snow"
Jon Snow,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me
Tyrion Lannister,Grenn's father left him too
He was given a choice,his right hand or the Wall
Jon Snow,They hate me because I'm better than they are
Tyrion Lannister,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik
Petyr Baelish,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason
Catelyn Stark,We have proof
Petyr Baelish,Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him
Catelyn Stark,Petyr has promised to help us find the truth
Petyr Baelish,"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake"
Catelyn Stark,I won't forget this
Petyr Baelish,Don't tell anyone
Cersei Baratheon,He's a child
What were you thinking? Jaime Lannister,I was thinking of us
What has the boy told them? Cersei Baratheon,Nothing
Jaime Lannister,We'll say he was lying
They can write a ballad about us,"\"The War for Cersei's Cunt"
Cersei Baratheon,Let me go
Jaime Lannister,Never
Cersei Baratheon,Let me go
Jaime Lannister,The boy won't talk
Catelyn Stark,I wish I could see the girls
Eddard Stark,It's too dangerous
Catelyn Stark,Just for a moment
Eddard Stark,Until we know who our enemies are
Catelyn Stark,"I know they did it, Ned"
Eddard Stark,Littlefinger's right
Catelyn Stark,"My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday"
Eddard Stark,He still loves you

You remember your first? Barristan Selmy,"Of course, your Grace"

Barristan Selmy,"A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina"
Robert Baratheon,Your outlaw
Any last words? Jaime Lannister,"I cut his head off, so no"
Robert Baratheon,What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked
Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve? Jaime Lannister,He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours
Daenerys Targaryen,Tell them all to stop
Jorah Mormont,You're learning to talk like a Queen
Daenerys Targaryen,Not a Queen

Tyrion Lannister,"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen"
May I call you Benjen? Benjen Stark,Call me what you like
Tyrion Lannister,I'm not sure what I've done to offend you
Benjen Stark,"You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word \"but\" really counts"
Tyrion Lannister,But
Benjen Stark,You're right
Yoren,"Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm"
Benjen Stark,"Enjoy the capital, brother"
Yoren,I always do
Tyrion Lannister,I think he's starting to like me
"\"Going below\"? Yoren",Into the tunnel and out the other side
Tyrion Lannister,So you're heading down to King's Landing too
Yoren,Day after tomorrow
Tyrion Lannister,Let's share the road
Yoren,"I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord"
Tyrion Lannister,Not this time
Irri,"Yes, Khaleesi"
Jorah Mormont,"For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle"
Rakharo,Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses
Jorah Mormont,Armor
Rakharo,Armor
Vroz? Jorah Mormont,Slow
Rakharo,Slow
Jorah Mormont,"It's true, but it also keeps a man alive"
Rakharo,My father taught me how to fight

Rakharo,He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo
"And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also? Jorah Mormont",He still is
Irri,The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight
Rakharo,There are no rabbits
Irri,"Find some ducks, she likes ducks"
Rakharo,"Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks"
Do you have eyes in your head? Do you? Irri,Dog then
Jorah Mormont,I don't think she wants to eat dog
Irri,The Khaleesi have baby inside her
Rakharo,A blessing from the Great Stallion
Irri,She does not want to eat horse
Jorah Mormont,I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper
Rhakaro,We ride for Vaes Dothrak
Jorah Mormont,Don't worry
Jon Snow,Don't stand so still
Maester Aemon,This summer has lasted nine
The Starks are always right eventually,winter is coming
Jeor Mormont,"We've been capturing wildlings, more every month"
Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids"
Jeor Mormont,One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions
Maester Aemon,The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond
Jeor Mormont,Your sister sits by the side of the King
Maester Aemon,"When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready"
Daenerys Targaryen,It’s a boy
