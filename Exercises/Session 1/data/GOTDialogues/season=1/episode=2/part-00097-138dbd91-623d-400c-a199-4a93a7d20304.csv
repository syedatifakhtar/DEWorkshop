Jorah Mormont,"You need to drink, child"
Jorah Mormont,"We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace"
Viserys Targaryen,I have no interest in hospitality or comfort
Jorah Mormont,"As you wish, your Grace"
Viserys Targaryen,"Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading"
What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver? Jorah Mormont,Selling to one
Viserys Targaryen,"Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense"
Joffrey Baratheon,"Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle"

Cersei Baratheon,I still can't believe you're going
Tyrion Lannister,"Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers"
Jaime Lannister,Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black
Tyrion Lannister,And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock
Cersei Baratheon,The children don't need to hear your filth
Jaime Lannister,"Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque"
Tyrion Lannister,"Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree"
Jaime Lannister,"My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on"
Tyrion Lannister,"My dear brother, you wound me"
Cersei Baratheon,Please
Catelyn Stark,"I would have dressed, your Grace"
Cersei Baratheon,This is your home
Catelyn Stark,I never knew
Cersei Baratheon,It was years ago
Catelyn Stark,I am grateful

Jaime Lannister,Good man
Have you swung it yet? Jon Snow,Of course I have

Catelyn Stark,That's what men always say when honor calls
Eddard Stark,You can

Jon Snow,You Starks are hard to kill
Robb Stark,Good
Jon Snow,It was always my color
Robb Stark,"Farewell, Snow"
Jon Snow,"And you, Stark"
Eddard Stark,There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch
Robert Baratheon,"Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going"
Eddard Stark,I've half a mind to go with you
Robert Baratheon,"What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight"
Eddard Stark,You should have asked me 20 years ago
Robert Baratheon,"There were wars to fight, women to marry"
Eddard Stark,I recall a few chances
Robert Baratheon,There was that one
Eddard Stark,Bessie
Robert Baratheon,Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits

Eddard Stark,The worst thing about your coronation
Robert Baratheon,"Trust me, that's not the worst thing"
Eddard Stark,Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord
What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift? Robert Baratheon,"A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it"
Eddard Stark,She's little more than a child
Robert Baratheon,Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding
Eddard Stark,Tell me we're not speaking of this
Robert Baratheon,"Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family"
Eddard Stark,"Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea"
Robert Baratheon,There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper
Eddard Stark,He will not cross
Robert Baratheon,"There's a war coming, Ned"
Benjen Stark,Sit
Tyrion Lannister,Rapers
Jon Snow,Until your brother killed that King
Tyrion Lannister,"Yes, until my brother killed him"
"And you? What's your story, bastard? Jon Snow","Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf"
Tyrion Lannister,"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms"
Jon Snow,The Night's Watch protects the realm from
Tyrion Lannister,"Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about"

Catelyn Stark,What if he's wrong? Bran needs me
Robb Stark,Rickon needs you
Assassin,You're not supposed to be here
Catelyn Stark,"No! The man is an assassin, when he draws his blade, Catelyn begins to fend him off"

Jhiqui,It is known
Daenerys Targaryen,Leave me with her
Doreah,Men like to talk when they're happy
Benjen Stark,Welcome
Catelyn Stark,What I am about to tell you must remain between us
Maester Luwin,The boy was always sure-footed before
Catelyn Stark,Someone tried to kill him twice
Rodrick Cassel,Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man
Robb Stark,They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want
Theon Greyjoy,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you"
Maester Luwin,"What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war"
Catelyn Stark,I don't trust a raven to carry these words
Robb Stark,I'll ride to King's Landing
Catelyn Stark,No
Robb Stark,"Mother, you can't"
Catelyn Stark,I must
Rodrick Cassel,I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you
Catelyn Stark,Too large a party attracts unwanted attention
Rodrick Cassel,Let me accompany you at least
Doreah,"No, Khaleesi"
Daenerys Targaryen,"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman"
Doreah,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi"
Daenerys Targaryen,I don't think that this is the Dothraki way
Sansa Stark,"Pardon me, Ser"
Sandor Clegane,"Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too"

Sansa Stark,He the butcher's boy
Arya Stark,He's my friend
Joffrey Baratheon,"A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy"
Mycah,"She asked me to, my Lord"
Joffrey Baratheon,"I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword"
Mycah,"It's not a sword, my prince"
Joffrey Baratheon,And you're not a Knight
Joffrey Baratheon,I won't hurt him
Filthy little bitch! Sansa Stark,"No no, stop it, stop it, both of you"
Sansa Stark,"Arya, leave him alone"
Joffrey Baratheon,Then go! Don't touch me
Soldier 1,The wolf's not here
Arya Stark,You've got to go

Cersei Baratheon,She's not
Robert Baratheon,"Now, child"
Sansa Stark,I don't know
Robert Baratheon,"What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight"
Cersei Baratheon,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life
Robert Baratheon,You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined
Eddard Stark,"Gladly, your Grace"
Soldier,"We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace"
Robert Baratheon,So be it
Cersei Baratheon,We have another wolf
Robert Baratheon,As you will
Eddard Stark,You can't mean it
Robert Baratheon,A direwolf's no pet
Please! It wasn't Lady! Eddard Stark,s this your command
Cersei Baratheon,"Ser Ilyn, do me the honor"
Eddard Stark,No
