JON SNOW,"I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna"
In fact- - LYANNA,I think we’ve had enough small talk
What are you here? JON SNOW,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed
It said- - LYANNA,I remember what it said
” JON SNOW,"Robb is gone, but House Stark is not"

SANSA,"I did what I had to do to survive, my lady"
LYANNA,If you say so
JON SNOW,"Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady"
"What you have to understand, my lady, is that- - LYANNA",I understand that I’m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here
DAVOS,"If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel"

JAIME,It won’t stop with Edmure
BRYNDEN,Hundreds of mine
JAIME,We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you
BRYNDEN,Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand
JAIME,"The war is over, ser"
BRYNDEN,"As long as I’m standing, the war is not over"
JAIME,You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives
BRYNDEN,Sieges are dull
JAIME,"Well, now you have"
BRYNDEN,"Aye, now I have"
ROBETT,The answer is no
JON SNOW,"Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out"
ROBETT,I’ve heard enough
JON SNOW,The Boltons are traitors
Who is fighting in this army? JON SNOW,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings
ROBETT,Then the rumors are true
JON SNOW,Lord Glover
ROBETT,There’s nothing else to say
SANSA,I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark
ROBETT,"Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries"
ROBETT,And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore
