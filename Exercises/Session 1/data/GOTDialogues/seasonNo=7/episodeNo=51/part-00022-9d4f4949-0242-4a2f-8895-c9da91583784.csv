TYRION,The bastard of Winterfell
JON,The dwarf of Casterly Rock
TYRION,I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall
JON,"You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right"
TYRION,It's been a long road
TYRION,I'm Tyrion Lannister
DAVOS,Davos Seaworth
TYRION,"Ah, the Onion Knight"
DAVOS,Unluckily for me
TYRION,Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor
MISSANDEI,Welcome to Dragonstone
JON,Of course
MISSANDEI,"Please, this way"
DAVOS,Where are you from? I can't place the accent
MISSANDEI,I was born on the Island of Naarth
DAVOS,Ah
DAVOS,This place has changed
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAY The group are making their way up to Dragonstone along a narrow stone pathway built into the cliffs leading to the castle
TYRION,"And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well"
JON,She is
TYRION,Does she miss me terribly? JON looks at TYRION and doesn't say anything
TYRION,A sham marriage and unconsummated
JON,She's starting to let on
TYRION,Good
JON,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen
TYRION,A long and bloody tale
JON,My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here
TYRION,Of course they do
JON,True
TYRION,"I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do"
TYRION,Come
VARYS,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests
Don't you want to see him again? MELISANDRE,I've done my part
VARYS,Strange
MELISANDRE,My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end
VARYS,"Oh, I doubt that"
MELISANDRE,Neither of us is common folk anymore
VARYS,Good
MELISANDRE,"I will return, dear spider"
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM JON approaches the throne room
MISSANDEI,"You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains"
DAVOS,This is Jon Snow
DAVOS,He's King in the North
DAENERYS,"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords"
JON,"The winds were kind, Your Grace"
DAVOS,Apologies
DAERNEYS,"Forgive me, Ser Davos"
But do I have my facts wrong? DAVOS,"I wasn't there, My Grace"
DAENERYS,No
"In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion? TYRION",Forever
DAENERYS,Forever
JON,I am not
DAENERYS,Oh
You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen? JON,Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive
DAENERYS,My father was an evil man
JON,You're right
TYRION,Almost
JON,But you haven't stormed King's Landing
DAENERYS,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help"
JON,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair"
DAENERYS,You told me you liked this man
TYRION,I do
DAENERYS,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child"
TYRION,I believe he's calling all of us children
JON,"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north"
DAENERYS,"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north"
JON,I am not your enemy
DAENERYS,The dead? DAENERYS addresses TYRION
DAENERYS,Is that another figure of speech? JON answers her before Tyrion
JON,The Army of the Dead is on the march
JON,The Army of the Dead is real
JON,-- we're finished
DAENERYS,I was born at Dragonstone
DAENERYS,We fled before Robert's assassins could find us
DAENERYS,They did for me
JON,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King
TYRION,The war against my sister has already begun
TYRION,-- whatever you saw beyond the wall
DAVOS,You don't believe him
DAVOS,"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North"
DAVOS,"All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things"
DAVOS,If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die
TYRION,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel
TYRION,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys
JON,There's no time for that
While we stand here debating -- TYRION,It takes no time to bend the knee
JON,And why would I do that? JON turns to speak to DAENERYS
JON,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you"
DAENERYS,That's fair
DAENERYS,You must forgive my manners
VARYS,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne
CAPTAIN,You wouldn't be here if you tried
CUT TO,"KING'S LANDING - STREETS EURON is escorting prisoners YARA GREYJOY, ELLARIA and TYENE SAND"
EURON(to YARA),This is the life
EURON,"I have to be honest, it's making me hard"
EURON,Oh no! EURON laughs
EURON,What a twat
CUT TO,"RED KEEP - THRONE ROOM CERSEI is sitting on the throne surrounded by QYBURN, JAIME, and THE MOUNTAIN"
EURON,My queen
EURON,I give you -- EURON looks over to JAIME
EURON,-- what no other man could give
CERSEI,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown
EURON,A bit more than a true friend
CERSEI,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism
EURON,There's only one reward I want
CERSEI,You shall have what your heart desires -- JAIME looks over at CERSEI
CERSEI,-- when the war is won
CERSEI,"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country"
EURON,"There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people"
JAIME,"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike"
EURON,Or yours
EURON,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now"
CUT TO,"RED KEEP - DUNGEONS THE MOUNTAIN, CERSEI and QYBURN are standing in a torch lit dungeon beneath the Red Keep"
CERSEI,I want you to know I understand
ELLARIA struggles against her restraints CERSEI,The sound of your scream
CERSEI,It doesn't matter now
CERSEI,Your daughter is a beauty too
CERSEI,I imagine she is your favorite
CERSEI,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites"
CERSEI,I'm sorry
CERSEI,We all make our choices
CERSEI,"Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really"
CERSEI,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull
CERSEI,She's so beautiful
TYENE,Momma! ELLARIA screams and looks at CERSEI
CERSEI,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know"
"The long goodbye, was that it? QYBURN",The Long Farewell
CERSEI,That's the one
CERSEI,Your daughter will die here in this cell
CERSEI,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours
CUT TO,RED KEEP - JAIME'S QUARTERS JAIME sets his gold hand down on the table and pours himself a glass of wine
JAIME,No
JAIME,Don't
MESSENGER,"Forgive me, Your Grace"
CERSEI,Good
MESSENGER,"At once, Your Grace"
CUT TO,RED KEEP - COUNCIL ROOM CERSEI is pouring two glasses of wine
TYCHO,"No, thank you"
TYCHO,"My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son"
CERSEI,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences
TYCHO,Condolences and congratulations
CERSEI,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident
TYCHO,Indeed
CERSEI,The Iron Bank wants its gold back
TYCHO,Your father never minced words either
CERSEI,And we both know gold wins wars
TYCHO,Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies
CERSEI,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner
TYCHO,We don't make bets
CERSEI,That's a fancy way of saying bet
TYCHO,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea
CERSEI,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me
TYCHO,For now
How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons? CERSEI,Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think
How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves? TYCHO,"The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true"
CERSEI,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch
CERSEI,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts
Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons? TYCHO,Your father's daughter indeed
CERSEI,Give me a fortnight
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - CLIFFS TYRION is walking along the cliffs and sees JON standing alone looking out into the ocean
TYRION,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack
JON,I'm a prisoner on this island
TYRION,I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island
JON,Except to my ship
TYRION,I wouldn't say we took your ship
JON,I'm not playing word games with you
TYRION,"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men"
JON,It's hard for me to fathom
JON,You probably don't believe me
TYRION,I do actually
JON,You didn't before
TYRION,It was all nonsense
JON,I know it's a good question
TYRION,People's minds aren't made for problems that large
JON,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming
TYRION,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily
JON,Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes
TYRION,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us"
TYRION,So do you have anything reasonable to ask? JON stops and turns back around
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE DAENERYS and TYRION are having a discussion
DAENERYS,Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies
TYRION,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally"
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - WALKWAYS DAENERYS is at the bottom of the path looking out into the ocean
JON,Amazing thing to see
DAENERYS,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon
DAENERYS,You lost two brothers as well? JON shakes his head
DAENERYS,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are
JON,He enjoys talking
DAENERYS,We all enjoy what we're good at
JON,I don't
DAENERYS,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne
JON,I never expected that you would
DAENERYS,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne
JON,I haven't either
DAENERYS,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it
JON,Thank you
CUT TO,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD Men are working in the courtyard rolling carts of hey and carrying water
SANSA,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell"
WOLKAN,"No, My Lady, most likely not"
SANSA,We must prepare for that eventuality
YOHN,"Very wise, My Lady"
SANSA,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it? WOLKAN bows and leaves"
YOHN,"You there, why isn't there leather on these? SANSA and BAELISH continue walking"
BAELISH,Command suits you
SANSA,So they should be
BAELISH,I know Cersei better than anyone here
If you turn your back on her -- SANSA,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here
BAELISH,One of two things will happen
BAELISH,Don't fight in the north or the south
GUARD,"Lady Sansa, at the gate"
BRAN,"Hello, Sansa"
CUT TO,WINTERFELL - WEIRWOOD TREE SANSA and BRAN are sitting next to the Weirwood Tree having a discussion
SANSA,I wish Jon was here
BRAN,Yes
SANSA,Your father's last living true born son
BRAN,I can never be the Lord of Winterfell
SANSA,I don't know what that means
BRAN,It's difficult to explain
SANSA,"Try, please, for me"
BRAN,It means I can see everything
SANSA,I thought you were the three-eyed raven
BRAN,I told you it's difficult to explain
SANSA,"I have to go back inside, Bran"
BRAN,I'll stay a bit longer
CUT TO,"CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS ARCHMAESTER MARWYN, SAMWELL TARLEY and JORAH MORMONT are standing in JORAH's quarantine room"
MARWYN,Hmm
MARWYN,Hmm
Does it hurt? JORAH,A bit
MARWYN,The infection no longer appears to be active
MARWYN,Unusual
JORAH,I don't know anything about that
JORAH,And the climate
MARWYN,"The climate? You're free to go, Ser"
MARWYN,"Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening"
SAMWELL,Where will you go? JORAH puts on his shirt and begins tying it up
JORAH,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it
JORAH,I owe my life to her and you
SAMWELL,Your father saved me more than once
CUT TO,ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY MARWYN AND SAMWELL are having a discussion
MARWYN,I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful
How? SAMWELL,I read the books and followed the instructions
MARWYN,That man is alive because of you
SAMWELL,"Thank you, Archmaester"
MARWYN,Come here
MARWYN,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away
MARWYN,You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel
CUT TO,"DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE DAENERYS, VARYS, MISSANDEI and TYRION are standing around the painted table having a discussion"
DAENERYS,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it
VARYS,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet"
To send our remaining ships after him -- DAENERYS,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him
TYRION,But you'll have to go yourself
DAENERYS,I wouldn't be alone
What can anyone do to them? MISSANDEI,They can still do something to you
TYRION,It's too great a risk
TYRION,Yes
CUT TO,CASTERLY ROCK TYRION continues narrating as the castle is seen in the distance on top of some cliffs
TYRION,No one has ever taken the rock
TYRION,The Lannister army is still the army my father built
TYRION,They will be ready
MAN,Draw! Loose! Archers loose a set of arrows down onto rows of Unsullied marching on the walls of the castle
TYRION,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable
TYRION,The fight up the walls will be hard
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE TYRION starts narrating a different battle plan
TYRION,Interesting thing about my father
CUT TO,CASTERLY ROCK - CLIFFS TYRION continues to narrate
TYRION,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers
TYRION,No better place for low pursuits
TYRION,"As a good friend of mine once said, \"give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch"
TYRION,And so it begins
TYRION,"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater"
UNSULLIED 1,There are none left
GREY WORM,There are supposed to be more than this
CUT TO,HIGHGARDEN - COURTYARD Some time has passed
CUT TO,OLENNA'S QUARTERS Olenna is sitting alone at a table wearing all black
OLENNA,And now the rains weep for our whores
Did we fight well? JAIME,I suppose as well as can be expected
OLENNA,It was never our forte
JAIME,The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore
OLENNA,Yes
JAIME,My father always said I was a slow learner
OLENNA,If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough
OLENNA,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it"
What did he call it? JAIME,Widow's Wail
OLENNA,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders"
"She's a monster, you do know that? JAIME","To you, sure"
"But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it? OLENNA",You love her
JAIME,Possibly
"Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there? OLENNA",What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right
JAIME,"Yes, it has"
OLENNA,She's a disease
JAIME,I think we're done here
OLENNA,That's good
OLENNA,"I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple"
