TYRION,"On a night like this, you came into the world"
VARYS,I remember that storm
DAENERYS,I wish I could remember it
DAENERYS,I always thought this would be a homecoming
TYRION,We won't stay on Dragonstone for long
DAENERYS,Good
DAENERYS looks at the figurines placed on the table DAENERYS,Not so many lions
VARYS,Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms
DAENERYS,They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health? DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS
DAENERYS,"People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them"
DAENERYS,"If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already"
TYRION,Conquering Westeros would be easy for you
DAENERYS,No
TYRION,We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse
DAENERYS,I never properly thanked you for that
VARYS,"They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you"
DAENERYS,But you didn't serve him long
VARYS,"Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure"
DAENERYS,So you took it upon yourself to find a better one
"All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion? VARYS","Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful"
DAENERYS,So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki
VARYS,Which you turned to your advantage
DAENERYS,Who hired the assassins? DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS
TYRION,Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant
DAENERYS,Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite
What king of a servant is that? VARYS,The kind the realm needs
DAENERYS,"Swear this to me, Varys"
VARYS,"I swear it, my queen"
DAENERYS,"And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive"
VARYS,I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons
GREY WORM,"Forgive me, my queen"
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM MELISANDRE is standing alone in the throne room
MELISANDRE,"Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded"
DAENERYS,The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen
What is your name? MELISANDRE,I am called Melisandre
VARYS,She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne
"It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it? MELISANDRE","No, it didn't"
DAENERYS,You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone
DAENERYS,We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king
DAENERYS,What does your Lord expect from me? MELISANDRE begins speaking Valyrian again
MELISANDRE,The Long Night is coming
DAENERYS,The prince who was promised will bring the dawn
MISSANDEI,"Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate"
DAENERYS,He sounds like quite a man
MELISANDRE,Summon Jon Snow
TYRION,"I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character"
TYRION,"If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally"
DAENERYS,Very well
CUT TO,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD Young boys and girls are practicing archery
SANSA,Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap
JON,Read the last bit
SANSA,"\"All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes"
"\" What does that mean? JON",It's something he said to me the first night we met
What do you think? SANSA,Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters
"\" DAVOS",Sounds like a charmer
CUT TO,RED KEEP - THRONEROOM CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne
CERSEI,"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it"
CERSEI,You all remember the Mad King
The lords murmur louder CERSEI,"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords"
RANDYLL,"She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace"
QYBURN,"We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord"
JAIME,Lord Tarley
RANDYLL,"Ser, Jaime"
DICKON,"Ser, Jaime"
JAIME,That's it
JAIME walks past Dickon and begins a discussion with Randyll JAIME,Thank you for coming
RANDYLL,"If my queen summons me, I answer the call"
JAIME,And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle
Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could -- RANDYLL,"It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime"
How may I serve? JAIME,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come
RANDYLL,Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley
JAIME,"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley"
RANDYLL,I've known Olenna since I was a child
JAIME,"She was a great woman, once"
Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs? RANDYLL nods his head in agreement JAIME,When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south
CUT TO,"CITADEL - QUARANTINE ROOMS ARCHMAESTER MARWYN, SAMWELL and JORAH are standing together in the quarantine room"
MARWYN,The infection has spread too far
JORAH,But how long 'till
MARWYN,"Your mind? Six months, maybe fewer"
SAMWELL,"Pardon, Archmaester"
MARWYN,Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately
MARWYN,"This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser"
MARWYN,"Come, Samwell"
SAMWELL,"Should we send word to your family, Ser"
JORAH,Jorah
MARWYN is waiting for SAMWELL in the hallway MARWYN,"Come, Samwell"
CUT TO,UNDER THE RED KEEP - DUNGEONS QYBURN and CERSEI are walking along the torch lit dungeon passing the dragon skulls
QYBURN,Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed
CERSEI,They were his trophies
QYBURN,Balerion the Dread
QYBURN,Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen
QYBURN,"The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace"
CUT TO,"DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE DAENERYS, YARA GREYJOY, THEON GREYJOY, ELLARIA SAND, OLENNA TYRELL, VARYS, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and TYRION LANNISTER are standing around a carved table of Westeros having a discussion"
YARA,"If you want the Iron Throne, take it"
TYRION,"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms"
ELLARIA,It's called war
TYRION,I know how you wage war
ELLARIA,She was a Lannister
DAENERYS,That's enough
DAENERYS,I am not here to be queen of the ashes
OLENNA,That's very nice to hear
DAENERYS,"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council"
TYRION,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied
TYRION,"Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country"
TYRION,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing
TYRION,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army
OLENNA,"So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own? TYRION reaches down and picks up the figurine resembling an Unsullied helmet"
TYRION,The unsullied will have another objective
ELLIA,"Dorne is with you, Your Grace"
DAENERYS,Thank you all
DAENERYS,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me
OLENNA,Peace
Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman? DAENERYS nods her hod in agreement OLENNA,"He's a clever man, your Hand"
GREY WORM,Enter
MISSANDEI,You leave tomorrow
Were you going to say goodbye? GREY WORM,I will see you when I return
MISSANDEI,But you don't know when that will be
GREYWORM,No one knows
MISSANDEI,I wish you good fortune
GREY WORM,Missandei -- MISSANDEI stops and turns back towards GREY WORM
GREY WORM,It is hard for me to say goodbye to you
MISSANDEI,I don't
GREY WORM,You are my weakness
MISSANDEI,I believe it
GREY WORM,Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth
MISSANDEI,I do too
GREY WORM,No
MISSANDEI,I want to see you
MARWYN,It might be useful
MARWYN,Maester Faol was quite the opposite
SAMWELL,"Archmaester, if I could just have a moment"
MARWYN,This is your moment
SAMWELL,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah
MARWYN,I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases
SAMWELL,Oh
MARWYN,The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden
CUT TO,QUARANTINE ROOMS A few hours have passed
SAMWELL,Hello

MAN #1,One more round

ARYA,I didn't do that
HOT PIE,I can't believe you're here
Did she ever find you? ARYA,She found me
HOT PIE,What happened to you Ary? ARYA pauses and doesn't answer HOT PIE
ARYA,You got any ale? Hot Pie starts to reach for a pitcher on the tray
HOT PIE,I heard she blew up the Great Sept
ARYA,Hmm
HOT PIE,I can't believe someone could do that
ARYA,Cersei would do that
HOT PIE,I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell
ARYA,Why would I go there? The Boltons have it
HOT PIE,No
ARYA,You're lying
HOT PIE,Why would I lie about that? He's your brother right? ARYA starts picking up her things to leave
ARYA,Thanks for the pie
HOT PIE,Friends don't pay
ARYA,Thanks
ARYA,"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie"
HOT PIE,"No, I won't"
ARYA turns and exits the Inn CUT TO,EXT

JON,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone
JON,He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen
JON,Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept
There is a negative outcry from the lords gathered in the hall JON,"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords"
The lords nod in agreement JON,"But more importantly, we need allies"
SANSA,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive
JON,I know that
SANSA,She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms
JON,"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that"
YOHN ROYCE,"Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa"
ROBETT GLOVER,"We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom"
LYANNA MORMONT,"Winter is here, Your Grace"
JON,You all crowned me your king
SANSA,Then send an emissary

SANSA,You're abandoning your people
JON,I'm leaving both in good hands
