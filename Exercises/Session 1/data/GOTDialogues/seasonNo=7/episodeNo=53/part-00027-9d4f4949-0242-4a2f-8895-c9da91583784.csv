JAIME,You could have killed me
BRONN,You saw the dragon between you and her? BRONN looks incredulously at JAIME
BRONN,And? JAIME sits up and says nothing to BRONN
BRONN,"Listen to me, cunt"
JAIME,That was only one of them
"If she decides to use them, to really use them -- BRONN",You're fucked

BRONN,Best well jump back in that river
CUT TO,KING'S LANDING - BATTLEGROUND TYRION is walking over an ash covered ground
DAENERYS,"I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities -- The camera pans around the prisoners"
DAENERYS,"-- burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children"
DAENERYS,"Step forward, My Lord"
TYRION,"My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time"
RANDYLL,There are no easy choices in war
DAENERYS,You will not trade your honor for your life
TYRION,"Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace"
RANDYLL,You cannot send me to the Wall
DICKON,You will have to kill me too
RANDYLL,Step back and shut your mouth
DICKON,"I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley"
TYRION,You are the future of your house
DICKON,I will not
TYRION,"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell"
DAENERYS,I meant what I said
TYRION,Your Grace -- DAENERYS looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal
DAENERYS,"Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die"
DAENERYS,Dracarys
CUT TO,KING'S LANDING - HALLWAY JAIME is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room
QYBURN,My Lord
CERSEI,It's armies that win wars
CERSEI,"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be"
JAIME,I just saw the Dothraki fight
CERSEI,"So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered"
CERSEI,Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son
JAIME,He didn't
CERSEI,"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body"
JAIME,I'm not talking about father
CERSEI,I shouldn't have listened to you
JAIME,"She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house"
CERSEI,So we fight and die or we submit and die
CUT TO,EXT
DAENERYS,They're not beasts to me
JON,You weren't gone long
DAENERYS,No
DAENERYS,We both want to help people
JON,Ser Davos gets carried away
DAENERYS,So it was a figure of speech? JON doesn't say anything
GUARD,"This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi"
DAENERYS,He is my friend
JORAH,Your Grace
DAENERYS,"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend"
JON,I served with your father
DAENERYS,You look strong
You found a cure? JORAH,I wouldn't be here if I hadn't

BRAN,Ravens
CUT TO,CITADEL - MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER ARCHMAESTER MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table
MAESTER 1,I put very little stock in it myself
MARWYN,I remember Wolkan
MAESTER 1,The north has dulled many good maester's wits
MAESTER 1,A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes
MARWYN,It is a bit much
Still we ought to -- SAMWELL,Brandon Stark -- The maesters all turn in their seats to look at SAMWELL
SAMWELL,-- the crippled boy
MAESTER 1,Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind
MARWYN,I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming
SAMWELL,Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you
MARWYN,It could be done
MAESTER 1,That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples
SAMWELL,"Archmaester, please"
MARWYN,We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification
MAESTER 2,"It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest"
MAESTER 1,Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer
MAESTER 2,Horrible business
MARWYN,I don't have the heart to tell him yet
MARWYN,Right
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - THRONE ROOM VARYS and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone
TYRION,All rulers demand that people bend the knee
What else could she do? VARYS,Not burn him alive alongside his son
TYRION,"I am her hand, not her head"
VARYS,That's what I used to tell myself about her father
VARYS,"It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, \"I'm not the one doing it"
TYRION,Daenerys is not her father
VARYS,And she never will be
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - CHAMBER OF THE PAINTED TABLE DAENERYS and VARYS are seated at the painted table
JON,I thought Arya was dead
DAENERYS,I'm happy for you
JON,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch
If they make it past the wall -- VARYS,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years
JON,I need to go home
DAENERYS,You said you don't have enough men
JON,We'll fight with the men we have
DAENERYS,And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in
TYRION,Perhaps not
What if we prove her wrong? JON,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation
TYRION,So bring the dead to her
DAENERYS,I thought that was what we are trying to avoid
TYRION,We don't have to bring the whole army
TYRION,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth
VARYS,Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital
TYRION,The only person she listens to is Jaime
DAENERYS,And how would you get into King's Landing
DAVOS,"I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter"
DAENERYS,"Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men"
VARYS,Fair point
JORAH,With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one
JORAH,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you
JON,The free folk will help us
DAVOS,They won't follow Ser Jorah
JON,They won't have to
DAVOS,You can't lead a raid beyond the wall
JON,I'm the only one here whose fought them
DAENERYS,I haven't given you permission to leave
JON,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission"

SANSA,I warned Jon this would happen
ARYA,He didn't
SANSA,"Well, he's not making it easy"
ARYA,These are mother and father's chambers
SANSA,Don't do that
ARYA,You always liked nice things
SANSA,"I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell"
ARYA,Not if they lose their heads first
SANSA,Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands
ARYA,"And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want"
SANSA,I have work to do
ARYA,My lady

BRONN,"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me"
BRONN,I'll leave you to it
TYRION,I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet
TYRION,You made me look like a complete fool
JAIME,Don't talk about our father
TYRION,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword
TYRION,He was going to execute me
JAIME,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself
TYRION,I -- I don't
CUT TO,KING'S LANDING - FLEA BOTTOM Men are in the market selling their wares
DAVOS,I wasn't sure I'd find you
DAVOS,I thought you might still be rowing
DAVOS,"I looked in shops, taverns, brothels"
DAVOS,Don't be so sure
GENDRY,You came to get me
DAVOS,You should know what you're heading into
GENDRY,Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer
GENDRY,I've been getting ready
DAVOS,You might want to bring one of those swords
GENDRY,"I don't know much about swinging swords, but this -- GENDRY removes a giant war hammer from the wall"

GUARD 2,I like wine
GUARD 1,Or hams
DAVOS,Come and have a look
DAVOS,Fermented crab
DAVOS,I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail
GUARD 2,"Oi, Dwarf! DAVOS quickly walks to cut the guards off"
DAVOS,I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you
GUARD 2,That dwarf -- The guards blow past DAVOS and begin talking to TYRION
GUARD 2,We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back
DAVOS,Perhaps there's some arrangement? The two guards turn back to DAVOS
GUARD 2,Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei? GENDRY can be seen behind the backs of the guards
DAVOS,This is Gendry
TYRION,He'll do
CUT TO,REDKEEP - CERSEI's QUARTERS JAIME opens the door and step into the queen's room
CERSEI,That won't be necessary
QYBURN,Ser Jaime
Why are you here? JAIME,I met with Tyrion
CERSEI,She just won a great victory
Why would she want a truce now? JAIME,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms
CERSEI,He betrayed you
JAIME,You let it happen
Why? CERSEI,I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest
JAIME,People won't like that
CERSEI,Never betray me again
CUT TO,DRAGONSTONE - BEACH GENDRY and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave
DAVOS,We're leaving today

GENDRY,You don't have to worry
DAVOS,"You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges"
GENDRY,Understood
DAVOS,"Begging your pardon, Your Grace"
JON,You survived King's Landing
DAVOS,Yet again
JON,"Your Grace, this is -- GENDRY steps forward in front of DAVOS"
GENDRY,"It's Gendry, Your Grace"
DAVOS,He was meant to keep that to himself
GENDRY,Our fathers trusted each other
Why shouldn't we? JON,I saw your father once at Winterfell
GENDRY,I met yours in my shop
JON,You're a lot leaner
GENDRY,You're a lot shorter
JON,I grew up on stories about them
GENDRY,All I ever knew was they fought together and won
DAVOS,Don't be a fool
GENDRY,"No, but I'm a fighter"
JON,Do you know how to use one? GENDRY shakes his head
JON,"Well, that's a problem"
GENDRY,I prefer a hammer
DAVOS,He can handle himself
JON,We could use the help
DAVOS,"As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life"
GENDRY(to DAVOS),I owe you my life
DAVOS,Yeah

JORAH,"Your Grace, I -- DAENERYS reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands"
JON,If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore
