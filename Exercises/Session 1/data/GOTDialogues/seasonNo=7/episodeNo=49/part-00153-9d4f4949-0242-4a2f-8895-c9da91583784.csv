WALDER FREY,You're wonder why I brought you all here
WALDER FREY,"Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family"
WALDER FREY,I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come
WALDERY FREY,Stand together! The Freys stand in unison
ALL,Stand together! The Freys drink
WALDER,Not you
WALDER,Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man
WALDER,"Yes, yes"
WALDER,"No, no, that was your mistake"
WALDER,Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe
ARYA,"When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers"
CUT TO,CASTLE BLACK - EXTERIOR GATE BRAN is lying in his sled
EDD,How do I know that's true? BRAN raises his head and stares at EDD
BRAN,You were at the Fist of the First Men
EDD,"Okay, come on"
JON,I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass
ROBETT,It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight
JON,Not just the boys
JON,We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting
ROBETT,You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand? LYANNA stands
LYANNA,I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me
ROBETT,"Indeed you are, my lady"
No one has questioned-- LYANNA,And I don't need your permission to defend the North
LYANNA,"We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island"
JON,"While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses"
JON,But if we're going to survive this winter together
TORMUND,You want us to man the castles for you? The men murmur
JON,Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome
TORMUND,Then that's where I'll go
JON,"If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold"
YOHN,The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North
SANSA,The castles committed no crimes
ALL,Aye! YOHN sits
JON,The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries
SANSA,And then they broke faith
JON,I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons
SANSA,So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty? The hall goes silent
JON,The punishment for treason is death
SANSA,They died fighting for Ramsay
JON,When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me
JON,Ned Umber
JON,Alys Karstark
JON,"For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield"
JON,Stand
JON,Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore
"Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always? NED & ALYS",Now and always! The men cheer and pound the tables
CUT TO,WINTERFELL - WALKWAY JON walks briskly along the walkway
JON,"You are my sister, but I am king now"
JON,Thank you
SANSA,"You're good at this, you know"
JON,No
SANSA,You are
SANSA,Why are you laughing? JON continues walking
JON,"What did father used to say? Everything before the word \"but\" is horse shit"
SANSA,He never said that to me
JON,No
SANSA,Because he was trying to protect us
JON,"All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me"
SANSA,I'm not trying to undermine you
SANSA,You have to be smarter than Father
WOLKAN,"A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace"
SANSA,"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south"
JON,I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him
SANSA,We still have a wall between us and the Night King
JON,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei
SANSA,"You're the military man, but I know her"
JON,You almost sound as if you admire her
SANSA,I learned a great deal from her
JAIME,He knew it
CERSEI,"It's ours now, we just have to take it"
CERSEI,You've been quiet since you came home
Are you angry with me? JAIME,"No, not angry"
Where will they land? JAIME,Dragonstone
JAIME,They have deep-water ports for the ships
CERSEI,Enemies to the east
CERSEI,Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches
CERSEI,"Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt"
CERSEI,Enemies to the north
How do we proceed? JAIME,Winter is here
CERSEI,I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms
JAIME,"Three kingdoms, at best"
CERSEI,I understand we're in a war for survival
JAIME,A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead
CERSEI,"A dynasty for us, then"
JAIME,We never talked about Tommen
CERSEI,There's nothing to say
JAIME,Our baby boy killed himself
CERSEI,He betrayed me
JAIME,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies
CERSEI,I heard
How could we ever trust a man like that? JAIME,We couldn't
JAIME,"Well, it looks like all of them"
CERSEI,"I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands"
JAIME,How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them
CERSEI,So does everyone when it suits them
JAIME,They're not good at anything
CERSEI,Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that
CUT TO,"KING'S LANDING - RED KEEP GREAT HALL CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne, flanked by JAIME and GREGOR"
EURON,"The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me"
EURON,"It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear"
JAIME,"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you? EURON smiles and walks backwards off the steps"
JAIME,"The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated"
EURON,I remember very well
JAIME,The people I was cutting down were your own kin
EURON,The place was getting crowded
JAIME,And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys
EURON,A good thing for me
CERSEI,If not the most humble
EURON,You're not humble
CERSEI,I decline your proposal
EURON,You should try it
EURON,I don't expect you to trust me outright

SAM,I was wondering if you had considered my proposition
MARWYN,I don't remember your proposition
SAM,"I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library"
MARWYN,That area is reserved for maesters
Are you a maester? SAM,No

BRIENNE,He wants something
SANSA,I know exactly what he wants
MAN (singing),He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are-- ARYA's horse neighs
ARYA,That's a pretty song
MAN,It's a new one

SANDOR,You're not bad
BERIC,"Thank you, Clegane"
SANDOR,But there's nothing special about you
BERIC,You're right about that
