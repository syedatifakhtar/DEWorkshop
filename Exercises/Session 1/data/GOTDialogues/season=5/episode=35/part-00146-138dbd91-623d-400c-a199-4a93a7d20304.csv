How do I know you are who you say you are? TYRION,If only I were otherwise
DAENERYS,If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word

ARYA,"Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade"
JAQEN,Lana is very impressive
ARYA,"Oysters, clams and cockles! Arya takes a right with the cart"

THIN MAN,Very nice
MAN,It’s my 18th voyage
THIN MAN,Can’t do it
MAN,Please I have 3 children
"Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don’t understand? He is carried away as the Thin Man slurps the oyster CUT TO",INT
THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE JAQEN,The man is a gambler

ARYA,The Many Faced God
JAQEN,A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not
WAIF,She is not ready
JAQEN,"Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not"

RAMSAY,I don’t need an army
TYRION,I can see why you would think so
DAENERYS,I know what my father was
TYRION,"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers"
DAENERYS,I did reopen the fighting pits
TYRION,"Yes, that was wise"
DAENERYS,Perhaps it won’t come to that
TYRION,It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all
DAENERYS,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys
TYRION,He did what he had to do to survive
DAENERYS,The brother who killed my father
TYRION,That’s the one
DAENERYS,Perhaps I will have you killed after all
TYRION,Your queenly prerogative
DAENERYS,I’m not going to kill you

DAENERYS,You’re going to advise me
TYRION,The Iron Throne
DAENERYS,If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool
TYRION,I’m not entirely joking
DAENERYS,I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold
TYRION,Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen
DAENERYS,"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell"
TYRION,It’s a beautiful dream
DAENERYS,I’m not going to stop the wheel

JON,Dragonglass
KARSI,There are old stories about Dragonglass
LOBODA,There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds
JON,I knew Mance Rayder
LOBODA,I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes
TORMUND,None of you saw Mance die! I did
"What it did took courage, and that’s what we need today",the courage to make peace with men we’ve been fighting for generations
KARSI,"I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows"
JON,I’m not asking you to forget your dead
LOBODA,My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow
KARSI,"So would mine, but fuck 'em, they’re dead"
TORMUND,This is the way
WILDLING ELDER,I’m with Tormund
GIANT,Tormund
LOBODA,Keep that new life you want to give us
KARSI (to Tormund),I fucking hate Thenns
JON,We’re leaving too many behind

HARDHOME - GATE LOBODA,Shut the gate
LOBODA,Shut the gate!! Men rush to put a board in place to hold the gate shut
SHOUTING,Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it! Loboda walks to the gate with his axe and peers through a small hole in the wall
LOBODA,Ready your arrows! The wights claw at the gate
JON,Get in line! Get in line! EXT
JON,You should be on one of those boats
KARSI,So should you ! My little girl has gone on
They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you’re not there ? JON,You have my word
KARSI,Don’t think you’re gonna be there to enforce those orders ! Karsi heads back to helping people onto the boats
LOBODA,Get the glass
JON,"Let’s go now! Now! Jon looks back to shore to see the Wights, along with a White Walker, killing the last surviving wildlings"
