ARYA,No! I’ve been here for weeks
WAIF,You will know why
WAIF,You tried already
ARYA,I didn’t even know I was playing
WAIF,Get back to work
WAIF,Get back to work
JAQEN,Who are you? Arya wakes up and turns to him
JAQEN,A lie
ARYA,After he was executed I fled the capital
JAQEN,A lie
ARYA,I stabbed him in the gut
JAQEN,A lie
ARYA,A man called the Hound
ARYA,I hated him
ARYA,I hated him! Jaqen hits her again
Does she truly want to be no one? ARYA,Yes
TYRION,"So, those villages we were supposed to find"
JORAH,I can
TYRION,"You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met"
JORAH,I am not your travelling companion
TYRION,We are travelling together
JORAH,I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities
TYRION,I killed my father
TYRION,"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man"
TYRION,You didn’t know
JORAH,We better keep moving
MAN,Valar morghulis
ARYA,Valar dohaeris
MAN,I have nowhere else to go
GIRL,It hurts
ARYA,I know
ARYA,I’ve devoted my life to him now
JAQEN,"Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever? Arya scans through the faces then fixates on one face in particular - that of an old lady"
JAQEN,No
COUNTRYSIDE TYRION,"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion"
JORAH,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean"
Do you believe there's a plan for this world? TYRION,No
JORAH,Neither did I
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing? TYRION,No
JORAH,It's hard to be a cynic after that
TYRION,Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen
JORAH,No it doesn’t
TYRION,The Targaryens are famously insane
"What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity? JORAH",First we have to conquer the world
TYRION,"We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true"
Then what? JORAH,Then she rules
TYRION,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king? Jorah sees a ship anchored in the middle of the sea and pushes Tyrion behind a rock"
MALKO,"Got a lot of fight in you, huh? Malko punches Jorah again"
SLAVER,Salt mines
MALKO,That or a galley slave
TYRION,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it"
And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf? SLAVER,It will be a dwarf-sized cock
TYRION,Guess again
MALKO,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant
JORAH,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery
MALKO,"We’re bound to Volantis, not Slaver’s Bay"
TYRION,"The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich"
TYRION,(looks at Jorah) Him
MALKO,Him? He’s got to be 60 years old
TYRION,"Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long"
Malko,Is that true? Jorah nods
TYRION,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself"
JORAH,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat
MALKO,Liar
JORAH,It’s no lie
LANCEL,Lord Baelish
BAELISH,Yes? (Lancel approaches him) Lancel Lannister
LANCEL,Brother Lancel
BAELISH,That’s quite a family to abandon
LANCEL,The city has changed since you were here last
BAELISH,Well done
BAELISH,I’m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother
LANCEL,"Step carefully, Lord Baelish"
BAELISH,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel"
BAELISH,Of course
CERSEI,The King’s orders
Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion? BAELISH,House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults
CERSEI,"House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish"
BAELISH,One’s choice of companion is a curious thing
CERSEI,Most curious
BAELISH,Lysa was a good woman
CERSEI,"She was neither of those things, we both know it"
BAELISH,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age
CERSEI,Good
BAELISH,"There is another matter, your Grace"
CERSEI,That’s not possible
BAELISH,My sources are well placed
CERSEI,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father
BAELISH,Indeed
CERSEI,We were fools to trust a turncloak
BAELISH,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house
CERSEI,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil
BAELISH,"I would counsel patience, your grace"
CERSEI,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor"
BAELISH,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell"
CERSEI,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here"
BAELISH,"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds"
CERSEI,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse
BAELISH,"Ser Jaime, then"
CERSEI,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission
BAELISH,Perhaps I can help
CERSEI,"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man"
BAELISH,You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury
CERSEI,I’ll speak to the king this evening
BAELISH,I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell
CERSEI,And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike
BAELISH,As I said
TRYSTANE,I’m going to ask him tomorrow
What is it? MYRCELLA,"Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you… Trystane kisses her in the middle of the sentence"
MYRCELLA,We can’t
TRYSTANE,You are going to be my wife
MYRCELLA,"They don’t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question"
DORAN,They make a lovely couple
AREO,"Yes, my prince"
DORAN,You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time
AREO,I remember how
DORNE - COUNTRYSIDE BRONN (singing),The Dornishman’s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring
JAIME,"Alright, thats enough"
BRONN,I’m coming to the best part
JAIME,We’re trying to blend in
BRONN,This song really is all about the ending
JAIME,It can wait
JAIME,That’s the Water Gardens
BRONN,That explains the golden hand
SHADOWY ROOM ELLARIA,"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken"
SAND SNAKES,For Oberyn
BRONN,"Well, she’s made herself at home"
JAIME,Myrcella
TRYSTANE,I am Trystane Martell
MYRCELLA,Trystane is my intended
JAIME,Excellent
TRYSTANE,"We weren’t expecting you, Ser Jaime"
BRONN,"Why don’t you let them have some time alone, son? Trystane inspects Bronn’s armor, looking for a sigil"
BRONN,Let’s not do something stupid
JAIME,"We have to go, Myrcella, now"
BRONN,Oh for fuck’s sake
OBARA,You’re coming with me
AREO,"Drop you weapons! The rest of Areo’s men surround the Sand Snakes, Bronn, and Jaime"
OBARA,I am Obara Sand
Who do you fight for? AREO,Drop your weapons! The Snakes drop their weapons
AREO,"When you were whole, it would have been a good fight"
BRONN (to Snake),You fight pretty good for a little girl
RIDER,Halt! Cut to inside the carriage
OLENNA,Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away
KING’S LANDING - GARDEN OLENNA,"Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got"
MARGAERY,Everyone knew about him and Renly
OLENNA,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms
MARGAERY,But he was the king’s brother
OLENNA,And Loras is the queen’s brother
MARGAERY,Cersei is behind this
OLENNA,Of course she is
OLENNA,"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way"
CERSEI,You must be exhausted
OLENNA,"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything"
CERSEI,"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns"
OLENNA,And the famous tart Queen Cersei
CERSEI,Beg your pardon
OLENNA,I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson
CERSEI,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras
Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare? OLENNA,I didn’t trust your father
CERSEI,House Lannister has no rival
SPARROW,You were said to be despondent when he died
"Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis’ army closed in LORAS",He was my friend
SPARROW,"Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly"
LORAS,I was wrong to support Renly’s claim
SPARROW,Wearing Renly’s armor
LORAS,Of course I deny them
SPARROW,You never lay with Renly Baratheon
LORAS,Never
SPARROW,Nor any other man
LORAS,Never
SPARROW,That will be all Ser Loras
OLENNA,Well I think that’s quite enough of that
SPARROW,Faith calls Queen Margaery forward
MARGAERY,I am the queen
SPARROW,You are
SPARROW,"Thank you, your grace"
CERSEI,This testimony is an insult to a great house
Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden? OLYVAR,"He has a birthmark, your grace"
SPARROW,The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras
MARGAERY,"Tommen! Tommen! King Tommen looks around the room, unsure of what to do"
MARGAERY,"You can’t do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you! Olenna glares at Cersei"
MYRANDA,You’re so beautiful
SANSA,"And how long have you loved him, Myranda"
SANSA,Yes? INT
THEON,"I’ve come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady"
"If you please, my lady, will you take my arm? SANSA",No
THEON,"Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm"
SANSA,I’m not touching you
THEON,Please
SANSA,Do you think I care what he does to you
RAMSAY,Ramsay of House Bolton
Who gives her? THEON,Theon of House Greyjoy
ROOSE,"Lady Sansa, will you take this man? Long pause"
SANSA,I take this man
RAMSAY,Are you pleased my lady? Sansa nods
RAMSAY,Good
SANSA,Yes
RAMSAY,"Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage"
"We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don’t you think? SANSA",Yes sir
RAMSAY,Good
RAMSAY,"Oh, no no no"
RAMSAY,Reek? I told you to watch
RAMSAY,You’ve known Sansa since she was a girl
