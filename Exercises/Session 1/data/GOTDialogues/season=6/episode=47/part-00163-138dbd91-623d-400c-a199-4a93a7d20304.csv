TYRION,"Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise"
TYRION,Perhaps we should take shelter
TYRION,"Well, not all the people, of course"
TYRION,
DAENERYS,Good
TYRION,Probably not
DAENERYS,This is entirely different
TYRION,You’re talking about destroying cities
CUT TO,"MEEREEN - PLATEAU DAENERYS, TYRION, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and an assembly of Unsullied stand across from the three Masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION, and a group of their soldiers"
RAZDAL (to DAENERYS),"Once before, I offered you peace"
TYRION,"We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults"
YEZZAN,The terms are simple
DAENERYS,We obviously didn’t communicate clearly
RAZDAL,I imagine it’s difficult adjust to the new reality
DAENERYS,My reign has just begun
CUT TO,MEEREEN - BEACH ENTRANCE A group of the Sons of the Harpy are slaughtering citizens of Meereen
CUT TO,MEEREEN - HARBOR DAENERYS and the dragons fly over the Masters’ ships
DAENERYS,Dracarys
CUT TO,MEEREEN - PLATEAU GREY WORM steps forward and addresses the Masters’ soldiers
GREY WORM,
TYRION,Thank you for the armada
MISSANDEI,Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes
TYRION,"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying? RAZDAL grabs YEZZAN"
RAZDAL,Him
BELICHO,"Yes, him"
RAZDAL,He’s not one of us
YEZZAN,Please
TYRION,Tell your people what happened here
JON SNOW,You don’t have to be here
SANSA,"Yes, I do"
RAMSAY,My beloved wife
RAMSAY,Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely
JON SNOW,You’re right
RAMSAY,"I keep hearing stories about you, bastard"
"You have, what, half that? Not even? JON SNOW","Aye, you have the numbers"
RAMSAY,He’s good
"Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you’re too proud to surrender? SANSA",How do we know you have him? RAMSAY nods to SMALLJON
RAMSAY (to JON SNOW),"She’s a fine woman, your sister"
CUT TO,"STARK ENCAMPMENT - CONFERENCE TENT JON SNOW, DAVOS, TORMUND, and SANSA are standing around a planning table"
JON SNOW,"If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out"
DAVOS,That’s not his way
JON SNOW,"It’s his weakness, too"
TORMUND,It’s not his men that worry me
TORMUND,You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow
JON SNOW,We’re digging trenches all along our flanks
JON SNOW,A pincer move
JON SNOW,They won’t be able to hit us from the sides
TORMUND,Good
DAVOS,It’s crucial that we let them charge at us
DAVOS,We should all get some sleep
TORMUND,"Rest, Jon Snow"
SANSA,"So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans"
JON SNOW,"Aye, for what they’re worth"
SANSA,"You’ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know"
Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight? JON SNOW,You’re right
SANSA,You think he’s going to fall into your trap
JON SNOW,He’s overconfident
SANSA,He plays with people
JON SNOW,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton"
SANSA,You don’t know him
JON SNOW,"All right, tell me"
What should we do? How do we get Rickon back? SANSA,We’ll never get him back
JON SNOW,We can’t give up on our brother
SANSA,"Listen to me, please"
JON SNOW,Of course he does
What should I do differently? SANSA,I don’t know! I don’t know anything about battles! Just don’t do what he wants you to do
JON SNOW,"Aye, that’s good advice"
SANSA,"If Ramsay wins, I’m not going back there alive"
SANSA,No one can protect me
CUT TO,STARK ENCAMPMENT DAVOS and TORMUND are walking together through the encampment
"You want to avenge your king, don’t you? DAVOS",It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis
DAVOS,"No, it’s a manner of speaking"
TORMUND,Oh
DAVOS,"Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings"
TORMUND,Jon Snow’s not a king
DAVOS,"No, he’s not"
TORMUND,I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight
DAVOS,"No, thanks"
TORMUND,Happy shitting
CUT TO,"STARK ENCAMPMENT - MELISANDRE’S TENT MELISANDRE is sitting at a desk with a mirror and candles on it, staring into a fire pit"
JON SNOW,My lady
MELISANDRE,I’m not a soldier
JON SNOW,"If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back"
MELISANDRE,I’ll have to try

THEON,It was a long time ago
TYRION,It was
THEON,I didn’t murder the Stark boys
YARA,And he paid for them
TYRION,Doesn’t seem like it
"But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we? DAENERYS",You’ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them
"In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands? THEON",Not my claim
TYRION,We can agree upon that at least
THEON,Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence
DAENERYS,Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king
YARA,You and I have that in common
DAENERYS,We do
THEON,There are and Euron is building more
He also wants to give you -- YARA,"His big cock, I think he said"
THEON,He murdered our father and would have murdered us
TYRION,The Seven Kingdoms
THEON,All of them
DAENERYS,Reasonable
DAENERYS,You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms
YARA,That’s our way of life
DAENERYS,No more
YARA,No more
RAMSAY,"Do you like games, little man? Let’s play a game"
RAMSAY,"No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules"
TORMUND (to himself),Don’t
DAVOS,Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge! The Bolton archers draw and loose a volley of arrows
RAMSAY,Now
KARSTARK,"Cavalry, charge! JON SNOW stands to face the Bolton cavalry, charging at him"
DAVOS,We’ll just kill our own men
RAMSAY,Loose! The Bolton archers fire
JON SNOW,Get word -- The Stark footsoldier is taken in the head by an arrow
DAVOS,We may as well be taking shits back here
DAVOS,Follow! DAVOS unsheathes his sword and charges across the field
RAMSAY,"It’s time, go"
TORMUND,Hey! WUN WUN and the Wildlings charge up behind TORMUND and JON SNOW
MAN,"Infantry, advance! The shield soldiers grunt in unison, lift their shields, and move in towards the Stark forces"
DAVOS,"With me, lads! Break their line! WUN WUN rushes the shield wall and swipes at the spears"
TORMUND,"Fuck this, come on! TORMUND leads the Wildlings back towards the piles of bodies"
CUT TO,WINTERFELL - COURTYARD RAMSAY and several Bolton soldiers enter the courtyard through Winterfell’s main gate
RAMSAY,Their army’s gone
MAN,Our army’s gone
RAMSAY,We have Winterfell
RAMSAY (to JON SNOW),"You suggested one on one combat, didn’t you? Stark archers aim their bows at RAMSAY"
RAMSAY,I’ve reconsidered
JON SNOW,We’re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father
SANSA,Jon
RAMSAY,Ah
SANSA,Your words will disappear
RAMSAY,My hounds will never harm me
SANSA,You haven’t fed them in seven days
RAMSAY,They’re loyal beasts
SANSA,They were
RAMSAY,Sit
