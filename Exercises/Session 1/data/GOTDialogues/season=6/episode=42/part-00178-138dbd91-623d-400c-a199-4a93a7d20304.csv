JON SNOW,We were children
SANSA,"I was awful, just admit it"
JON SNOW,You were occasionally awful
SANSA,Forgive me
JON SNOW,All right
JON SNOW,"You’d think after thousands of years, the Night’s Watch would have learned how to make a good ale"

SANSA,They owe you their lives
SANSA,Winterfell is our home

LITTLEFINGER,My lord
LITTLEFINGER,I missed your name day
YOHN ROYCE,"Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers"
LITTLEFINGER,Indeed I was
YOHN ROYCE,"And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell"
LITTLEFINGER,"On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men"
YOHN ROYCE,"Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him"
LITTLEFINGER,Your home is the Vale
ROBIN,Shall we throw him through the Moon Door? The surrounding knights begin to approach YOHN ROYCE
YOHN ROYCE,My lord
ROBIN,"Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr? YOHN ROYCE turns back to look at LITTLEFINGER"
LITTLEFINGER,Lord Royce has served the Vale well
YOHN ROYCE,"You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord"
LITTLEFINGER,I think he deserves one more chance
What do you say? ROBIN,Fine
LITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN),I bring good news
ROBIN,She’s my cousin
LITTLEFINGER,That was my instinct as well
LITTLEFINGER,Our lord has spoken
GREY WORM,I don’t make peace with the queen’s enemies
TYRION,"Yes, that’s the military approach"
MISSANDEI,Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her
MISSANDEI,How many days were you a slave? TYRION stammers
TYRION,Long enough to know
MISSANDEI,Not long enough to understand
CUT TO,"MEEREEN - COUNCIL CHAMBER TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are sitting in attendance to three masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION"
YEZZAN,I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor
TYRION,And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor
RAZDAL,We came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch
TYRION,"Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want"
BELICHO,We want you to leave Slaver’s Bay
TYRION,Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever
RAZDAL,"When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs"
MISSANDEI,"She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains"
RAZDAL,As they have since the dawn of time
GREY WORM,Not anymore
YEZZAN,You think you’re a free man now? You still follow orders
TYRION,"Friends, friends, friends, please"
TYRION,There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing
YEZZAN,Slavery is the way of our world
TYRION,You don’t need slaves to make money
TYRION,"Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices"
YEZZAN,We do not support the Sons of the Harpy
TYRION,"Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same"
TYRION,Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it
TYRION,Give freedom a chance

MAN #1,We speak the Common Tongue
TYRION,Excellent
MAN #2,You met with the slavers today
TYRION,I did
MAN #1,Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum
TYRION,I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled
TYRION,But I am not your ruler
MAN #1,You are a stranger here
So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies? TYRION,Because our queen chose me as her advisor
MAN #1,We don’t know you
TYRION,And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations
MAN #2 (speaking Valyrian),"Missandei, you know what these men are"
How can you trust them? MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian),I do not trust them
MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian),"But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends"
CUT TO,"MEEREEN - GREAT PYRAMID SEASIDE TYRION, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI are walking together"
GREY WORM,Do not use me for your lies
TYRION,Those men respect you
GREY WORM,They respect me because they know who I am
TYRION,As do I
GREY WORM,"I am loyal to my queen, not you"
TYRION,I am not betraying her work
MISSANDEI,You promised the slavers they could keep slavery
TYRION,For a short time
MISSANDEI,Seven years is not a short time for a slave
TYRION,You’re right
GREY WORM,You are wrong to trust these men
TYRION,I don’t trust the Masters
GREY WORM,You don’t know them
TYRION,They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast
GREY WORM,You will not use them
DAARIO,I don’t think you could ride the dragon

DAARIO,We’ll all disappoint her before long
JORAH,We need each other right now
After we’re done needing each other -- DAARIO,"Oh, I don’t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal"
JORAH,"The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway"
JORAH,"Eastern Market, Western Market"
But if they see weapons… DAARIO,You’re asking a dog to hand over his teeth
JORAH,"There’s 100,000 of them down there"
DARRIO,Uh… DAARIO flips the knife around in his hand
DAARIO,I’m very attached to this knife
JORAH,Don’t worry

DAENERYS,I will never run from Dothraki
LEADER (to LHAZAREEN WOMAN),"Go, show her"

LHAZAREEN WOMAN,They do stink
DAENERYS,You must have been very young when your Khal died
LHAZAREEN WOMAN,Sixteen
DAENERYS,Too bad he didn’t die sooner
LHAZAREEN WOMAN,"Yes, too bad"
Would you like to see them one day? LHAZAREEN WOMAN,I am Dosh Khaleen
DAENERYS,"No, don’t hurt her"
DAARIO,She’ll give us away
JORAH,We have to go now
DAENERYS,We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive
JORAH,All we can do is try
DAENERYS,No

TOMMEN,We need to be careful in dealing with such a man

CUT TO,RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER KEVAN and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start
CERSEI,The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders
LADY OLENNA,I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time
CERSEI,You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals
LADY OLENNA,"My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep"
What’s left to work with? JAIME,Cersei is the mother of the king
CERSEI,The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back
LADY OLENNA,"Oh, no"
CERSEi,I agree
JAIME (to KEVAN),You’ve got the second largest army in Westeros
KEVAN,The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen’s safety
JAIME,You’ll take no action at all
"When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome? CERSEI",You hate these fanatics as much as we do
Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good? KEVAN,Of course I want him back
CERSEI,Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed
KEVAN,"If it doesn’t go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city"
LADY OLENNA,Many will die no matter what we do

RAMSAY,"Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore"

RAMSAY,Are you sure you know what that is? OSHA comes closer and sits down on his lap
