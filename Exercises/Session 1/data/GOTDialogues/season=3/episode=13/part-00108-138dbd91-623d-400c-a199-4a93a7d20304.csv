CATELYN,It's dangerous
[ROBB nods in agreement ROBB,"If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible"
[ROBB pours himself something to drink ROBB,Now Winterfell is burned to the ground
[ROBB pauses ROBB,"So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice"
CATELYN,If Walder Frey cooperates
"[Close up shots of the map showing the sigils of House Stark, House Frey and House Lannister CATELYN","If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea"
[ROBB moves the House Frey piece to the House Stark side of the map ROBB,We'll lose the war and die the way father died
[A flash of anger spreads across CATELYN's face CATELYN,Show them how it feels to lose what they love
"ROBB takes a piece of bread, dips it into the salt and eats it while looking intently at WALDER WALDER","My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table"
ROBB,"We thank you for your hospitality, my lord"
He takes a piece of bread from the plate and eats it ROBB,"I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness"
WALDER,"Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace"
[WALDER signals for his female relatives to appear before ROBB WALDER,"One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are"
"[As WALDER calls each relative by name, they briefly look up at ROBB WALDER","This is Arwyn, my daughter"
[WALDER pauses to chew WALDER,My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila
[EDMURE intently watches the Frey women WALDER,"Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins"
[EDMURE closes his eyes after hearing WALDER'S comments about his granddaughters WALDER,My granddaughter Marianne
EDMURE raises his eyebrows MERRY,I'm Merry
WALDER,Fine
[ROBB looks at the Frey women ROBB,My ladies
[WALDER claps to signal the dismissal of the Frey women WALDER,Very good
[WALDER focuses on TALISA WALDER,There she is
WALDER moves forward in his seat and squints WALDER,Still can't see you
She bows her head WALDER,Love
[WALDER leans forward with a grin WALDER,I can always see what's going on beneath a dress
"[WALDER grins, ROBB visibly uncomfortable WALDER",Your king says he betrayed me for love
[ROBB starts to step forward before CATELYN stops him WALDER,And I can respect that
[ROBB visibly angry ROBB,"Thank you, my lord"
[WALDER stands up and claps WALDER,"Well, let's get ready"
Inside her tent are her closest advisers,"DAARIO NAHARIS, BARRISTAN SELMY, JORAH MORMONT and GREY WORM"
JORAH watches him closely DAARIO,"There, it's a back gate"
[DAENERYS briefly looks up at DAARIO and JORAH briefly looks at her DAARIO,This is where we enter the city
BARRISTAN,We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate
DAARIO,I kill the guards
JORAH looks at GREY WORM who briefly looks back DAARIO,Then comes the army
JORAH,"Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army"
DAARIO,You have a very suspicious mind
[JORAH sighs and looks at Grey Worm JORAH,You command the Unsullied
What do you think? DAENERYS,"[Speaking to Grey Worm in Valyrian Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa"
GREY WORM,[In Valyrian I trust him
DAENERYS,"[Speaking in the Common Tongue (in this case, English) again You leave tonight"
JORAH,Very good
BARRISTAN walks towards JORAH BARRISTAN,Ser Jorah
JORAH,"You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan"
"SAMWELL TARLY, GILLY and her baby are walking south towards Castle Black SAMWELL","We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us"
GILLY,You're like a wizard
"Next shot, GILLY and SAMWELL gaze up at the Wall GILLY",Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived
They see a PIG FARMER along the way who's having trouble with the wheel spokes on his cart THE HOUND,Remember what happens to children who run
[THE HOUND hands the horse reins to ARYA and walks over to the PIG FARMER PIG FARMER,"The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning"
[THE HOUND lifts the cart up PIG FARMER,Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding
"[PIG FARMER fixes the wheel, THE HOUND sets the cart down PIG FARMER",Many thanks
"THE HOUND then unsheathes his dagger and prepares to kill him, prompting ARYA to intervene ARYA",Don't! Don't kill him
THE HOUND,Dead rats don't squeak
ARYA,"You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls"
THE HOUND,More than anyone you know
ARYA,You're wrong
THE HOUND,Good
[THE HOUND again tries to approach the PIG FARMER in order to kill him but ARYA again intervenes pushing him back ARYA,Don't kill him! Please
[THE HOUND pauses then sheathes his dagger THE HOUND,You're very kind
JOJEN,Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment
MEERA,It’s good land and there’s no war up here
Why leave? BRAN,Wildlings
[BRAN looks at OSHA who stares back at him BRAN,Sorry
RICKON,Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it
[OSHA stares at RICKON who looks back at her RICKON,That’s what Old Nan said
JOJEN,There’s a storm coming
BRAN,I don’t see any
"[Thunder rumbling, everyone looks up at the sky and at the windmill MEERA",It’s as good a place to shelter as any
OSHA puts her hand on RICKON’S head OSHA,We can drink some blood while we wait
"JON SNOW, TORMUND GIANTSBANE, ORELL, YGRITTE are hiding, waiting for ORELL’S scouting report ORELL",Only one old man and eight good horses
ORELL,Not today they don’t
TORMUND,And proper steel
ORELL,Let’s carve him up
JON,We just take the horses and go
[ORELL looks at TORMUND ORELL,I keep telling you
[YGRITTE looks at JON YGRITTE,He’s an old man
[JON looks at TORMUND JON,The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief
TORMUND,I hope so
[TORMUND announces to the rest of the wildlings TORMUND,Spread out
ARYA walks back to THE HOUND ARYA,No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all
[THE HOUND waves a pig’s foot at ARYA THE HOUND,Best part of the animal
[THE HOUND continues to eat while ARYA gazes back at the Twins THE HOUND,"Don’t worry, they’re still there"
[ARYA angrily turns back and looks at THE HOUND ARYA,I know they’re still there
THE HOUND,You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move
ARYA,I’m not afraid
THE HOUND,Of course you are
ARYA,I knew fear when I saw it in you
[THE HOUND pauses ARYA,"When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl"
[ARYA moves in closer to THE HOUND ARYA,"And I know why, too"
THE HOUND,Go ahead then
[ARYA turns around and angrily stares at THE HOUND ARYA,Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull
The storm has already begun BRAN,How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it’s 700 feet high
BRAN,It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals
OSHA,Some climb straight up the ice
[BRAN looks at HODOR BRAN,Even Hodor’s not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back
BRAN,My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted
[MEERA looks at Bran MEERA,"Well, we’ll have to open them up again"
HODOR,Hodor! [Horses neighing outside
OSHA tries to quiet down HODOR OSHA,"It’s just thunder, sweet giant"
HODOR,Hodor
OLD MAN,[From outside I yield
JOJEN,Wildlings
If they hear us… BRAN,"[To Hodor Hush, Hodor"
OSHA,You need to keep quiet
JOJEN,They’re gonna hear us
He stops and looks up BRAN,"Hodor, be quiet"
[HODOR continues Hodoring BRAN,"Hodor, calm down"
ORELL is still looking up at the windmill WILDLING 1,Bring them over here
WILDLING 2,That was the last of them
ORELL,[To TORMUND I heard shouting up there
TORMUND,Thunder
ORELL,I know the difference between shouting and thunder
TORMUND,Maybe it's ghosts
"He pulls a knife out on TORMUND, YGRITTE gets her bow and arrow out and aims for the OLD MAN TORMUND","That won’t help you, grandpa"
ORELL,Cut his throat or he’ll tell the crows we’re here
[TORMUND unsheathes his sword TORMUND,You understand
OLD MAN,Let me stand at least
"[BRAN and RICKON’S direwolves, Shaggydog and Summer, are seen hiding behind a cart, outside of the windmill OLD MAN",Let me go with a bit of dignity
He then gets in position for the kill Orell,[Looks at JON Make the crow kill him
The scene changes to back inside of the windmill Jojen,[Looks at BRAN The wolves are out there
BRAN,I can’t do it by choice
JOJEN,"You’re a warg, Bran"
BRAN,I can’t
JOJEN,"You just did, with him"
[JOJEN looks at HODOR who is still resting JOJEN,A wolf is nothing compared to that
He places his sword against the OLD MAN’S neck OLD MAN,She looks sharp
"The OLD MAN closes his eyes and starts praying, JON hesitates YGRITTE",[Looks at Jon Do it
[JON looks back at YGRITTE ORELL,Told ya
TORMUND,"Go on, boy"
[JON glares back at TORMUND TORMUND,Go on! [JON raises his sword but hesitates
This prompts ORELL and TORMUND to reach for their swords ORELL,He’s a crow
[JON and YGRITTE are standing side by side in defensive positions TORMUND,Kill him! [YGRITTE prepares to shoot an arrow at either ORELL or TORMUND but JON pushes her to the ground first
She starts running away but TORMUND grabs her and tackles her to the ground TORMUND,You’re not gonna die for one of them
Everybody is looking at BRAN JOJEN,Do it
JON continues fighting ORELL until he impales him with Longclaw JON,You were right the whole time
"DAARIO, JORAH and GREY WORM are outside of the back gate DAARIO","When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come"
"[DAARIO approaches the back gate, a guard yells at him in Valyrian DAARIO",Daario Naharis
They see two dead guards and DAARIO sitting down DAARIO,That one was quick
"[DAARIO wiping blood off his arakh, a Dothraki blade JORAH",There may be others
DAARIO,I doubt it
The trio defeat the first wave of guards JORAH,"[Addressing DAARIO That’s what you call a few guards? [DAARIO smiles at JORAH as more Yunkish guards appear, surrounding the trio ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [The scene changes to right outside of The Twins, where the Stark army are set up in tents and passing the time with some wrestling"
ROSLIN gets down on her knees in front of EDMURE ROSLIN,"Lord Edmure, I hope I’m not a disappointment to you"
[EDMURE helps ROSLIN up EDMURE,"You’re a delight to me, my lady"
[ROSLIN smiles SEPTON,You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection
He walks back to ROSLIN’S side and the SEPTON ties EDMURE and ROSLIN'S hands together SEPTON,"In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity"
[EDMURE and ROSLIN turn to each other EDMURE & ROSLIN,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger"
BRAN,[Looks at JOJEN You were right
JOJEN,Of course you can
BRAN,"[Looks at RICKON When I was looking through Summer’s eyes, I saw Jon"
OSHA,He’ll be heading back to Castle Black then
BRAN,"For all we know, Castle Black’s already under attack"
If this many wildlings got through- OSHA,I already told you
BRAN,Everything Jojen told me is true
[OSHA grabs BRAN by the hand OSHA,"Listen to me, little lord"
BRAN,"Don’t worry, I’m not asking you to come with me"
RICKON,[Surprised Me? I’m coming with you
BRAN,No
RICKON,I’m coming with you
BRAN,"Right now, I have to protect you"
[RICKON'S eyes start tearing up BRAN,Robb’s at war and I’m going beyond the Wall
[RICKON stands up and looks at OSHA RICKON,We’re not Southerners
[RICKON turns around to look at BRAN RICKON,And I don’t want to leave you
OSHA,Shhh
BRAN looks at OSHA Bran,You don’t have to do any of this
[RICKON cries as OSHA strokes his hair OSHA,Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be
RICKON,"[Crying, looks at OSHA I know how to swing a sword"
She then gets up and helps RICKON up as well BRAN,You’re leaving now? It’s the middle of the night
OSHA,I learned to walk in darkness
[OSHA kisses RICKON on the head again OSHA,"Say your good-byes, little man"
The Reeds look at BRAN and RICKON and then switch their gaze to OSHA Osha,[Looks at the Reeds Keep this one safe
"She suddenly gets up and ignores the food, as she approaches BARRISTAN with impatience Daenerys",We’ve been waiting a long time
JORAH and GREY WORM are both tired and covered in blood JORAH,[Looks at DAENERYS It was just as you said
[DAENERYS likes the news but her face suddenly shows some worry DAENERYS,And Daario Naharis? [JORAH’S face goes from a smile to a look of shock
He drapes the flag over his knee and looks up at DAENERYS DAARIO,"The city is yours, my queen"
"Next shot is from across the hall, where ROOSE, BLACKFISH and CATELYN are seated, enjoying themselves BLACKFISH",Look at the crowd there
"Next to him is BLACK WALDER FREY, another one of WALDER'S sons CATELYN",[Looking at EDMURE and talking to BLACKFISH He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him
[Shot of EDMURE whispering in ROSLIN'S ear as she smiles BLACKFISH,The God’s love to reward a fool
CATELYN,[Laughs Uncle
BLACKFISH,"What? He’s my nephew, I love him"
BLACKFISH,That’s the point
[Still talking to ROOSE while the servant pours him more wine Didn’t you marry one of these Frey girls? ROOSE,Aye
CATELYN gives ROOSE a serious look CATELYN,I hope she makes you very happy
ROOSE,"Well, she’s made me very rich"
BLACKFISH,"Pardon, my lord, my lady"
"[BLACKFISH gets up from his seat and begins exiting the hall, as ROBB and TALISA look on ROBB",My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton
TALISA,Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I’ve ever met
ROBB,Be kind
TALISA,And I like her
ROBB,Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake
[TALISA gasps and tries to strike ROBB but he catches her hand ROBB,Striking your king is an act of treason
TALISA stops him TALISA,"No, don’t"
WALDER,[Addressing ROBB loudly so everybody can hear Your Grace
WALDER signals for the music and knocking to stop WALDER,"The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak"
Men start getting up from their seats and approach the main table EVERYBODY,[Chanting To bed! To bed! To bed! [The men pick up ROSLIN and carry her out of the hall
The men start removing some of ROSLIN'S clothes while the women start doing the same to EDMURE EDMURE,"Ho-ho! Careful now, ladies"
ROOSE,Every bride suffers the same
CATELYN,"Oh, Ned forbade it"
[ROOSE looks at CATELYN and chuckles before walking away [ROBB and TALISA watch as the bedding procession is almost finished TALISA,That is a very strange custom
ROBB,I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective
"[TALISA puts her hand on ROBB'S shoulder, runs it down his arm, before grabbing his hand and placing it on her stomach TALISA","No, but there are other ways of providing proof"
ROBB,"Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming"
TALISA,Eddard
[Catches ROBB by surprise Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses? ROBB,I do
"THE HOUND and ARYA approach the gate, riding the pig farmer’s cart THE HOUND","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa"
FREY GUARD,The feast is over
THE HOUND,It doesn’t sound like it’s over
[ARYA watches as Frey soldiers run into the Twins FREY GUARD,"If I tell you it’s over, it’s over"
THE HOUND,"Got pig’s feet, too [ARYA looks up"
FREY GUARD,[Infuriated Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around! [THE HOUND gives up
He addresses ROBB WALDER,Your Grace
ROOSE returns to the hall and sits next to CATELYN WALDER,I feel I’ve been remiss in my duties
"He's smiling as he looks down at his arm, inviting CATELYN to take a look WALDER",I’ve given you meat and wine and music but I haven’t shown you the hospitality you deserve
"She suddenly gets up from her seat and slaps ROOSE across the face, prompting him to run to the other side of the hall CATELYN",Robb! [LOTHAR pulls a knife out of his sleeve and repeatedly stabs TALISA in the stomach from behind
She starts walking towards the doorway until THE HOUND puts his hand on her shoulder and turns her around THE HOUND,It’s too late
WALDER notices and signals for everybody to stop WALDER,"The King in the North arises, heh heh"
The archers fix their sights on CATELYN CATELYN,"Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! [ROBB is still cradling TALISA on the floor My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance"
WALDER,[Angrily You already swore me one oath right here in my castle
[ROBB turns to CATELYN ROBB,Mother
He faces ROBB and grabs him by the shoulder ROOSE,The Lannisters send their regards
