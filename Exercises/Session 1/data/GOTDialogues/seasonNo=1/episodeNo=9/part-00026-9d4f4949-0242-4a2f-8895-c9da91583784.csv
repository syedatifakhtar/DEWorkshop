Eddard Stark,What do you want? Tell me

We can't expect his support? Greatjon Umber,Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised
Robb Stark,Father rots in a dungeon
Theon Greyjoy,Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing
Greatjon Umber,Not in time
Catelyn Stark,"The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll"

Walder Frey,Huh
You see how they pile up? Why are you here? Catelyn Stark,"To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way"
Walder Frey,"There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here"
Catelyn Stark,You swore an oath to my father
Walder Frey,"Oh, yes, l said some words"

You want to say that… Samwell Tarly,There was a raven
Jon Snow,l should be there
Greatjon Umber,"lf we do that, they'll never get back across"
Robb Stark,Huh
Catelyn Stark,Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you
Robb Stark,"Fine, fine"
And? Catelyn Stark,And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age

"lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do? Jon Snow","He would do whatever was right, no matter what"
Maester Aemon,"Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000"
What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile? Jon Snow,Sam told you
Maester Aemon,We're all human
Jon Snow,You do not know
Maester Aemon,The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows
What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South,"the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail"
Jon Snow,You're Aemon Targaryen
Maester Aemon,"l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch"

Eddark Stark,"I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King"
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say,"Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the grace of all the Gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm"
