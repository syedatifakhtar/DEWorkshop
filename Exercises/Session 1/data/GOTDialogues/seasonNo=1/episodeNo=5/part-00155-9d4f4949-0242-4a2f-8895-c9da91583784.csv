Eddard Stark,He'd never worn this armor before
Barristan Selmy,Bad luck for him
Eddard Stark,Aye
Barristan Selmy,Life is strange
Eddard Stark,"I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan"
Barristan Selmy,You're too modest
Eddard Stark,My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen
Barristan Selmy,"He was a fine man, your father"
Eddard Stark,And that lad
How could he afford a new suit of armor? Barristan Selmy,Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today
Eddard Stark,Yes
Barristan Selmy,Robert tends to do what he wants
Eddard Stark,"If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion"
Lancel Lannister,"It's made too small, Your Grace"
Robert Baratheon,Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse
Eddard Stark,You're too fat for your armor
Robert Baratheon,"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it? Both Robert and Ned begin laughing"
Robert Baratheon,You heard the Hand
Robert Baratheon,"All right, all right"
Eddard Stark,You have no business jousting
Robert Baratheon,Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that
will be you! Eddard Stark,There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you
Robert Baratheon,… Drink
Eddard Stark,I'm not thirsty

Sansa Stark,I can't watch
Petyr Baelish,100 gold dragons on the Mountain
Renly Baratheon,I'll take that bet
Sansa Stark,He's going to die
Eddard Stark,Ser Loras rides well
Renly Baratheon,"Such a shame, Littlefinger"
Sansa Stark,Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks
Petyr Baelish,No honor but quite a bit of gold

Maester Luwin,Hmm
Theon Greyjoy,Shh
Ros,I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here
Theon Greyjoy,Important enough for the likes of you
Ros,"You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know"
Theon Greyjoy,Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman
Ros,Might surprise you
Theon Greyjoy,Generous tipper
Ros,You are jealous
Theon Greyjoy,I'm a Greyjoy
Ros,"A “ward”, that’s a nice word for it"
Theon Greyjoy,My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore
Ros,You’re a very serious boy
Theon Greyjoy,I’m not a boy
Ros,"Oh, yes you are"
Theon Greyjoy,I don’t want to pay for it
Ros,Then get yourself a wife
Arya Stark,Come on
Varys,A blessing then
May I? Varys,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head"

Why have you waited so long to tell me this? Varys,I didn't trust you
Eddard Stark,Jon was a man of peace
Why kill him? Varys,He started asking questions
Varys,He's found one bastard already
Illyrio Mopatis,What good is war now? We're not ready
"If one Hand can die, why not a second? Varys",This Hand is not the other
Illyrio Mopatis,We need time
Varys,"\"Delay,\" you say"
Illyrio Mopatis,It never was
Varys,The first to arrive and the last to leave
Petyr Baelish,You do move quietly
Varys,We all have our qualities
Petyr Baelish,You look a bit lonely today
Varys,I think you're mistaking business with pleasure
Petyr Baelish,"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things"
Varys,"Oh, I'm sure"
Petyr Baelish,"I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important"
Varys,And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers
Petyr Baelish,"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws"
Varys,Strictly speaking
Petyr Baelish,Tell me
Varys,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close"

Petyr Baelish,One shudders at the thought
Varys,Oh
Petyr Baelish,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me
Varys,"Oh, please"
Petyr Baelish,To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King -- Renly enters from a different doorway and cuts both men off

Guard 1,Off with you
Arya Stark,I'm not a beggar
Guard 2,"I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me"
Guard 1,"You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends"
Arya Stark,My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy
Eddard Stark,You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop
Arya Stark,They said they were going to kill you
Eddard Stark,"Oh, Arya"

Robert Baratheon,I warned you this would happen
Eddard Stark,You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this
Robert Baratheon,"Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms"
Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood! Eddard Stark,Then we're no better than the Mad King
Robert Baratheon,"Careful, Ned"
Eddard Stark,You want to assassinate a girl
Because the Spider heard a rumor? Varys,"No rumor, my Lord"
Eddard Stark,"He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land"

He murdered the Hand of the King! Tyrion Lannister,Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man

Loras Tyrell,I want you
Renly Baratheon,My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man
"Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours? Loras Tyrell",Hold still
Renly Baratheon,"All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood"
Loras Tyrell,You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée
Renly Baratheon,Easy for you to say
Loras Tyrell,It's not a gift
Renly Baratheon,"I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you"
Loras Tyrell,"Yes well, I guess we'll never know"
So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die? Renly Baratheon,"It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is"
Loras Tyrell,It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife
Renly Baratheon,"He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money"
Loras Tyrell,I have an outrageous amount of money
Renly Baratheon,Not as much as the Lannisters
Loras Tyrell,But a lot more than you
Renly Baratheon,Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him
Loras Tyrell,Hmm
How did that ever happen? Renly Baratheon,Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it
Loras Tyrell,I am
Renly Baratheon,I'm fourth in line
Loras Tyrell,And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster
Renly Baratheon,He's still my older brother

Robert Baratheon,I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime
Cersei Baratheon,No
Was it really worth it? Losing him this way? Robert Baratheon,I don't know
Cersei Baratheon,The Dothraki don't sail
Robert Baratheon,"It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out"
Cersei Baratheon,We still outnumber them
Robert Baratheon,Five
Cersei Baratheon,Our marriage
Robert Baratheon,"Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together"
Don't you get tired? Cersei Baratheon,Every day
Robert Baratheon,"Yes, it is"
Cersei Baratheon,"Yes, it tis"
What was she like? Robert Baratheon,"You've never asked about her, not once"
Why not? Cersei Baratheon,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her"
Cersei Baratheon,"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually"
moment? Robert Baratheon,No
Does that make you feel better or worse? Cersei Baratheon,It doesn't make me feel anything

Eddard Stark,I will
Mhaegen,And tell him I've been with no one else
Eddard Stark,She looks healthy enough to me
Petyr Baelish,"Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found"
Eddard Stark,And Jon Arryn tracked them all down
Why? Petyr Baelish,He was the King's Hand
Eddard Stark,Come
Jaime Lannister,Such a small pack of wolves
Eddard Stark,I remember him well
Jaime Lannister,It seems he had some trouble on the road
"You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you? Eddard Stark",He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes
Jory Cassel,If you threaten my Lord again
Jaime Lannister,You're right
Jaime Lannister,"My brother, Lord Stark"
